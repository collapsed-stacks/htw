I propose to break down every topic into \"fields\". Some possible fields would be:\r\n\r\n - **Science** (possibly break this one down, ie physics, chem etc)\r\n\r\nExamples: How does electricity work? How does the Sun heat the Earth?\r\n  \r\n - **Technology**\r\n\r\nExamples: How does data get written to a CD? How do computers display video?\r\n\r\n - **Mechanics**\r\n\r\nExamples: How do cars use fuel? How do pulleys work?\r\n\r\nThese are the main ideas I can come up with right now, but I'm sure more will come.

Good answers should be fairly to-the-point, while providing a decent level of detail.  Answers which do not include enough information to adequately answer the question (such as \"Go google it\" or \"This page here explains how it works: <link>\", but not actually providing details in the answer about how something works) should be considered \"Not a good answer\" or a very very low-quality answer.\r\n\r\nAs to who we should consider \"experts\", i believe we should break it down into various categories.  \r\nSuch categories could be:  \r\n\r\n - Electronics Experts (electronics repair people, for example)\r\n - Computer Experts (computer technicians, for example)\r\n - Engineering Experts (engineers)\r\n - Automobile experts (automobile repair people, people who build/design automobiles, etc. for automobile questions [I noticed a few of them already])\r\n\r\nOf course, the above list is NOT all inclusive.

I agree this is **not** ok, and we need to work on that. I think learning then applying from using other sources to bolster your answers is great, and I do it most of mine. I think a good counter to this practice is plain ol' voting.   \r\n\r\n - I've seen exactly that in comments, and I don't like it. I like the idea of asking a question and getting a response to the question that I asked very specific to it, without reading a entire article that doesn't even touch on it.   I think this may happen because people see this as \"just another content site\" and don't want it to succeed. \r\n\r\n\r\n - I see what you're saying here, and again I think it's caused because people don't want to see this place succeed or they don't understand how it should work. For example how I think we could avoid this , @josh asked how does DSL work, but then he asked more specifically about how certain parts work. I replied with how it worked, then covered what he specifically wanted to know about certain parts of why DSL worked.

We really need to work on what's allowed, We don't want how does the universe work or a basic question that 6 million people have already asked. \r\n 2. We need to make this unique, it has to be worth it to come here vs Howstuffworks \r\n 3. We need to stop blatant copying and linking as a answer only, and get people to write unique content. \r\n\r\nI used we in all of those statements because those are things the community **needs** to discuss and decide on.

I truly believe in the Stack Exchange model, and I do believe that this site has a genuine purpose even when we also have Wikipedia. So I tried to think about *what it was specifically* that makes me love Stack Exchange sites more than Wikipedia.\r\n\r\n 1. **It's the voting system**\r\n   \r\n   I've been using the internet since before some of our users were born. I've been programming for even longer than that. So I've been asking people for help with programming problems for *a long time*, and *nowhere* have I found better answers than StackOverflow. Plus, SO gives better answers *faster* than anywhere else. And the same thing goes for ServerFault, SuperUser, and just about all the SE sites I use. The voting system makes the cream rise to the top. But it's more than that alone...\r\n   \r\n 1. **It's the reputation system**\r\n\r\n  In the \"dark days\" of the internet before Stack Exchange, on forums, listservs and BBS systems before those, there just wasn't that much incentive to put time and effort into helping people. The reputation system changes that, it makes people strive to take ownership of the site and really help each other by answering questions, editing questions, and building the best site possible. But, Wikipedia does an amazingly good job of being collaboratively edited with no reputation system...\r\n\r\n 1. **It's the *community***\r\n\r\n  You can't ask Wikipedia anything. I'm sure the editors and authors for Wikipedia have a sense of community and chat or talk amongst themselves somehow, but to me (and I assume a majority of others) *wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and not a community*. Having used StackOverflow from before SuperUser or ServerFault even existed, I can say I am **overwhelmed** at how the experience has changed in the past year. Chat has a *giant* part to do with this. Maybe I'm just biased because I'm the #2 chat user on Meta, but, I think that chat has really made this place a great community of users.\r\n\r\n### So what does this mean?\r\n\r\nWhat it means to me is that we need to put our strengths to use. Since we're a community and not just an encyclopedia, we have strengths Wikipedia doesn't. We can ask each other for much more analytical and in-depth knowledge that sure, maybe Wikipedia *has* but a *human being* has to gather from a wikipedia article and assimilate.\r\n\r\n**I think that this site can really excel with very specific, long-tail questions**. \r\n\r\n> How does *x* work?\r\n\r\nCan just be explained by reading the entire Wikipedia article. But if we start to ask,\r\n\r\n> How does *x* do *y*?\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n> Why is *x* better at *y* than *z*?\r\n\r\nWe're now asking for specific information which maybe is in the Wikipedia article, but you'd need to read the entire article to find the specific part. It's like on StackOverflow, if you ask a specific question, you get specific answers. But if you just ask \"How do I make code which does *x?*\" you get closed.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions should be extremely specific, and not ask for an overview of how an entire thing or technology works; instead, questions should be long-tailed and ask how one particular part of a thing or technology works.\r\n\r\n**Here's some good, specific question examples:**\r\n\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/152/20\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/10/20\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/11/20\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/20/20\r\n\r\nThe first example is not just \"How does a trolley work?\" but rather it's asking about a *very specific problem*. Trolley or traffic signals or cars are complicated machines... asking about a specific thing is much easier than reading an entire article on everything about them just for one piece of information.\r\n\r\n**Compare the above to these much broader questions:**\r\n\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/148/20\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/202/20\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/206/20\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/8/20\r\n\r\nI'm not saying these are bad questions. **I'm just saying these are the kind of questions which can get us into trouble**. \"How does a nuclear reactor work?\" is **so broad** that you really are better off reading the entire Wikipedia article. It would be like asking on StackOverflow \"How does Facebook work?\" -- it'll get closed in an instant. But if you ask about a specific part of Facebook, you're likely to get a specific and very interesting answer."}

But if you just ask \"How do I make code which does *x?*\" you get closed.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions should be extremely specific, and not ask for an overview of how an entire thing or technology works; instead, questions should be long-tailed and ask how one particular part of a thing or technology works.\r\n\r\n**Here's some good, specific question examples:**\r\n\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/152/20\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/10/20\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/11/20\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/20/20\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/questions/264/how-can-isps-get-more-speed-out-of-cable-internet-service/269#269\r\n\r\nThe first example is not just \"How does a trolley work?\" but rather it's asking about a *very specific problem*. Trolley or traffic signals or cars are complicated machines... asking about a specific thing is much easier than reading an entire article on everything about them just for one piece of information.\r\n\r\n**Compare the above to these much broader questions:**\r\n\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/148/20\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/202/20\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/206/20\r\n * http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/8/20\r\n\r\nI'm not saying these are bad questions. **I'm just saying these are the kind of questions which can get us into trouble**. \"How does a nuclear reactor work?\" is **so broad** that you really are better off reading the entire Wikipedia article. It would be like asking on StackOverflow \"How does Facebook work?\" -- it'll get closed in an instant. But if you ask about a specific part of Facebook, you're likely to get a specific and very interesting answer."}

I personally think this was a far more appropriate name for this Q&A site, because many questions that are perfect for \"Popular Science\" don't fit the **How Things Work** subject. At the same time, these question are too basic or uninteresting for the **Physics** stackexchange site.\r\n\r\nAlthough broadening the subject could improve things, to be honest I'm very pessimistic about the future of this site, because I haven't seen a single question that couldn't have been found in 2 minutes by doing a simple Google search.\r\n"}

Once you get past the \"quick Google search provides a few dozen perfectly good answers\" questions, you're stuck trying to attract experts to a site where they may well be a tiny, tiny minority - which misses the whole idea behind SE, where you get experts in some area together to participate in answering questions. \r\n\r\nSure, we could be content aiming for [mediocre][1] [\"everyman\" answers][2] and hoping that SE Magic somehow makes that work... But then all you've done is create yet another [content farm][3]:\r\n\r\n> CHACE: Maggio is a military wife who works from home with a Pomeranian on her lap. After looking for work for months in Fairfax, Virginia, where her husband is stationed, she decided to go back to school to get a masters degree in Psychology. She supports herself by freelance writing.\r\n\r\n> Ms. MAGGIO: My best day I wrote 10 in about 75 minutes. So you got to figure, I made 80 bucks in 75 minutes, which is decent. I mean, that's more than I made when I was working full time.\r\n\r\n> CHACE: It's 15 bucks an article for eHow, $8 an article for MadeMan.com, and a buck an article, plus revenue traffic, for Examiner.com.\r\n\r\n> -- NPR's Morning Edition, *[Google Tweaks Algorithm to Spot Content Farms](http://www.npr.org/2011/04/22/135625124/google-tweak-s-algorithm-to-spot-content-farms)*\r\n\r\n...with the same drudgery as the rest of the sites doing this, but without putting anyone through school.\r\n\r\n> 1. How do we ensure that we have a never-ending supply of question? Broadening our scope? or something else?\r\n> 2. How do we distinguish this site from a simple google search // wikipedia search // etc?\r\n\r\nThere's no reason this site shouldn't have an endless supply of questions. New *stuff* gets developed all the time, so if the goal is to explain how it works, then that problem is solved...\r\n\r\n...But the topic is already too broad and shallow. The solution to competing with Google/Wikipedia is *narrow and deep*, the exact opposite of where this site is headed.\r\n  [1]: http://meta.htw.stackexchange.com/questions/4/why-is-the-answer-to-most-questions-not-just-a-link-to-howstuffworks-com/5#5\r\n  [2]: http://meta.htw.stackexchange.com/questions/30/potential-for-mass-overlap-with-other-se-sites/31#31\r\n  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_farm"}

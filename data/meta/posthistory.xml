I propose to break down every topic into &quot;fields&quot;. Some possible fields would be:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Science** (possibly break this one down, ie physics, chem etc)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Examples: How does electricity work? How does the Sun heat the Earth?&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA; - **Technology**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Examples: How does data get written to a CD? How do computers display video?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Mechanics**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Examples: How do cars use fuel? How do pulleys work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the main ideas I can come up with right now, but I'm sure more will come.

Good answers should be fairly to-the-point, while providing a decent level of detail.  Answers which do not include enough information to adequately answer the question (such as &quot;Go google it&quot; or &quot;This page here explains how it works: &lt;link&gt;&quot;, but not actually providing details in the answer about how something works) should be considered &quot;Not a good answer&quot; or a very very low-quality answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As to who we should consider &quot;experts&quot;, i believe we should break it down into various categories.  &#xD;&#xA;Such categories could be:  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Electronics Experts (electronics repair people, for example)&#xD;&#xA; - Computer Experts (computer technicians, for example)&#xD;&#xA; - Engineering Experts (engineers)&#xD;&#xA; - Automobile experts (automobile repair people, people who build/design automobiles, etc. for automobile questions [I noticed a few of them already])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, the above list is NOT all inclusive.

I agree this is **not** ok, and we need to work on that. I think learning then applying from using other sources to bolster your answers is great, and I do it most of mine. I think a good counter to this practice is plain ol' voting.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - I've seen exactly that in comments, and I don't like it. I like the idea of asking a question and getting a response to the question that I asked very specific to it, without reading a entire article that doesn't even touch on it.   I think this may happen because people see this as &quot;just another content site&quot; and don't want it to succeed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - I see what you're saying here, and again I think it's caused because people don't want to see this place succeed or they don't understand how it should work. For example how I think we could avoid this , @josh asked how does DSL work, but then he asked more specifically about how certain parts work.

We need to make this unique, it has to be worth it to come here vs Howstuffworks &#xD;&#xA; 3.

I think we should start discussing how questions should be formatted, and what constitutes a great question. Also, by defining a good question criteria we should be able to extrapolate bad criteria.  I'll post my thoughts as an answer to keep the question neutral.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.htw.stackexchange.com/questions/33/what-are-things-in-context-of-the-faq" />

After looking for work for months in Fairfax, Virginia, where her husband is stationed, she decided to go back to school to get a masters degree in Psychology. She supports herself by freelance writing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Ms. MAGGIO: My best day I wrote 10 in about 75 minutes. So you got to figure, I made 80 bucks in 75 minutes, which is decent. I mean, that's more than I made when I was working full time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; CHACE: It's 15 bucks an article for eHow, $8 an article for MadeMan.com, and a buck an article, plus revenue traffic, for Examiner.com.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; -- NPR's Morning Edition, *[Google Tweaks Algorithm to Spot Content Farms](http://www.npr.org/2011/04/22/135625124/google-tweak-s-algorithm-to-spot-content-farms)*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;...with the same drudgery as the rest of the sites doing this, but without putting anyone through school.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. How do we ensure that we have a never-ending supply of question? Broadening our scope? or something else?&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. How do we distinguish this site from a simple google search // wikipedia search // etc?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's no reason this site shouldn't have an endless supply of questions. New *stuff* gets developed all the time, so if the goal is to explain how it works, then that problem is solved...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;...But the topic is already too broad and shallow. The solution to competing with Google/Wikipedia is *narrow and deep*, the exact opposite of where this site is headed.&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.htw.stackexchange.com/questions/4/why-is-the-answer-to-most-questions-not-just-a-link-to-howstuffworks-com/5#5&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.htw.stackexchange.com/questions/30/potential-for-mass-overlap-with-other-se-sites/31#31&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_farm" />

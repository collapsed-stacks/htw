First and foremost, <strong>we cannot have copyright infringement!!!</strong> <a href=\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">howstuffworks.com</a> is not an open and free encyclopedia like Wikipedia and copying articles verbatim or reusing their images will not only get Stack Exchange in trouble but <em>it is a terrible reflection on our community and our users</em>.</p>\n\n<p>However the point goes beyond that alone. <strong>This is a much bigger question than just \"how do we not be HowStuffWorks.com\"</strong> As Joel said, <em>we don't want to copy from or simply link to Wikipedia either</em>, even if copyright isn't a concern. I've been thinking about this a lot since reading Joel's posts, because I have a strong gut feeling that this can be a truly awesome Stack Exchange site, and I was trying to reconcile my feeling with some logical conclusions...</p>\n\n<p>I have said in answers and comments that it would be fine to ask questions which have large overlap with Wikipedia. I never meant to imply that it was okay to simply copy from Wikipedia, but as a counter-argument to someone who said that <a href=\"http://htw.stackexchange.com/\">htw.stackexchange.com</a> was pointless and would just end up mirroring <a href=\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">howstuffworks.com</a> or Wikipedia, I did say, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why even have this site when others like it exist? Because if you're not a Stack Exchange site than you're doing it wrong!!! StackExchgange FTW!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Clearly that was a playful comment, but at the same time <strong>it's so much more</strong>. I truly believe in the Stack Exchange model, and I do believe that this site has a genuine purpose even when we also have Wikipedia. So I tried to think about <em>what it was specifically</em> that makes me love Stack Exchange sites more than Wikipedia.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>It's the voting system</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've been using the internet since before some of our users were born. I've been programming for even longer than that. So I've been asking people for help with programming problems for <em>a long time</em>, and <em>nowhere</em> have I found better answers than StackOverflow. Plus, SO gives better answers <em>faster</em> than anywhere else. And the same thing goes for ServerFault, SuperUser, and just about all the SE sites I use. The voting system makes the cream rise to the top. But it's more than that alone...</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>It's the reputation system</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the \"dark days\" of the internet before Stack Exchange, on forums, listservs and BBS systems before those, there just wasn't that much incentive to put time and effort into helping people. The reputation system changes that, it makes people strive to take ownership of the site and really help each other by answering questions, editing questions, and building the best site possible. But, Wikipedia does an amazingly good job of being collaboratively edited with no reputation system...</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>It's the <em>community</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>You can't ask Wikipedia anything. I'm sure the editors and authors for Wikipedia have a sense of community and chat or talk amongst themselves somehow, but to me (and I assume a majority of others) <em>wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and not a community</em>. Having used StackOverflow from before SuperUser or ServerFault even existed, I can say I am <strong>overwhelmed</strong> at how the experience has changed in the past year. Chat has a <em>giant</em> part to do with this. Maybe I'm just biased because I'm the #2 chat user on Meta, but, I think that chat has really made this place a great community of users.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>So what does this mean?</h3>\n\n<p>What it means to me is that we need to put our strengths to use. Since we're a community and not just an encyclopedia, we have strengths Wikipedia doesn't. We can ask each other for much more analytical and in-depth knowledge that sure, maybe Wikipedia <em>has</em> but a <em>human being</em> has to gather from a wikipedia article and assimilate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I think that this site can really excel with very specific, long-tail questions</strong>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How does <em>x</em> work?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Can just be explained by reading the entire Wikipedia article. But if we start to ask,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How does <em>x</em> do <em>y</em>?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why is <em>x</em> better at <em>y</em> than <em>z</em>?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We're now asking for specific information which maybe is in the Wikipedia article, but you'd need to read the entire article to find the specific part. It's like on StackOverflow, if you ask a specific question, you get specific answers. But if you just ask \"How do I make code which does <em>x?</em>\" you get closed.</p>\n\n<p>Questions should be extremely specific, and not ask for an overview of how an entire thing or technology works; instead, questions should be long-tailed and ask how one particular part of a thing or technology works.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here's some good, specific question examples:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/152/20\">How do trolleybuses switch power lines</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/10/20\">How does a traffic signal detect when a vehicle is at the intersection?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/11/20\">How does a gasoline pump know when the tank is full?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/20/20\">How does a purely electrical car (like the Tesla Roadster) get away with having no transmission?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://htw.stackexchange.com/questions/264/how-can-isps-get-more-speed-out-of-cable-internet-service/269#269\">How can ISPs get more speed out of cable internet service?</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first example is not just \"How does a trolley work?\" but rather it's asking about a <em>very specific problem</em>. Trolley or traffic signals or cars are complicated machines... asking about a specific thing is much easier than reading an entire article on everything about them just for one piece of information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Compare the above to these much broader questions:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/148/20\">How does a nuclear reactor work?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/202/20\">How does a microwave oven work?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/206/20\">How does a flatbed scanner work?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://htw.stackexchange.com/q/8/20\">How does a Flash Drive work?</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm not saying these are bad questions. <strong>I'm just saying these are the kind of questions which can get us into trouble</strong>. \"How does a nuclear reactor work?\" is <strong>so broad</strong> that you really are better off reading the entire Wikipedia article. It would be like asking on StackOverflow \"How does Facebook work?\" -- it'll get closed in an instant. But if you ask about a specific part of Facebook, you're likely to get a specific and very interesting answer.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 20, "LastEditorUserId": 20, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-04-20T21:55:38.520", "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-20T21:55:38.520", "CommentCount": 6}

You can build logic control circuits with hydraulics instead of transistors if you are so inclined. Instead of electric switches and servos you can use valves. Do google image searches of dashboards for pre-1970s cars and you'll see automatic transmissions with D2, etc. Here is a 1972 AMC hornet, which would have been unlikely to have electronic control, with D2: http://www.justacargeek.com/2011/03/1972-amc-hornet-sportabout.html" CreationDate="2011-04-22T18:23:23.483" UserId="137" />

While mathematically its quite easy, try designing a circuit which can take three binary numbers, square them, sum the squares and then find the square root. The square root is especially hard."

  <row Id="298" PostId="40" Text="@Christopher: race car drivers don't &quot;pump the brakes&quot; while braking, whether they have ABS or not. What they do is &quot;pre-pump&quot; the brakes before entering the braking zone for a corner. This is done to make sure there's enough brake pressure available when entering the braking zone (brake pressure could have been lost due to several reasons in the run up to a corner) " CreationDate="2011-04-23T17:11:11.303" UserId="159" />
  <row Id="299" PostId="187" Text="LSD's (limited slip differentials) have little or no relation to TCS. The purpose of LSD is to *lock* the axle between the left and right driven wheels in order to have more traction in (tight) corners. TCS is an electronic system that prevents wheel spin under acceleration in general. In most modern race cars, TCS and LSD are used together (in fact, a race car without LSD is almost undrivable)" CreationDate="2011-04-23T17:23:12.043" UserId="159" />

There's one thing I wanted to add which others didn't mention: the core physics at work here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Friction is teh force between two objects as they try to move against each other, like your tires on the surface of the road. There's two kinds of friction: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction#Static_friction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Static Friction&lt;/a&gt; which is between two objects that are not moving against each other, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction#Kinetic_friction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kinetic Frictio&lt;/a&gt; which occurs when the limit of static friction has been reached, and the two objects &quot;slip&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For an example, press your hands against each other firmly and try to slide them. Before they move the resistance you experience is static friction. Once you apply enough force, you exceed the maximum force of static friction and they slip. Now the resistance is less: this is kinetic friction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When your tires are on the road's surface, the wheels turn at the same rate as the vehicle is moving, and the part of the tire in contact with the road is (hopefully) static. If you don't have ABS and you slam on the brakes, the force of the friction of the brakes may exceed the force of the static friction between your tires and the road -- especially on icy or wet roads. When this happens your tires will completely stop, yet your vehicle will keep going. Now, your tires only have the force of kinetic friction on the road -- they have&quot;locked up&quot;, and you have much less control because the force exerted by steering is far less.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ABS detects the motion of the wheels relative to the motion of the vehicle, and prevents the wheels from locking up by releasing the force of the brakes when it detects lockup. This is why you feel your brake pedal push back at you when this happens. This is also why you're told to &quot;pump&quot; your breaks if you &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; have ABS. It's all about keeping the much higher force of static friction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="20" LastActivityDate="2011-04-18T21:10:56.530" CommentCount="4" />

The net effect of these dual magnets is that the current coming out from the output line is some multiple of what the input line is, and as power is conserved, the voltage must also be half. A transformer which is not connected to a load will still draw power. These transformations can be lossless, although small losses are common.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DC step down, or more commonly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Voltage dividers&lt;/a&gt;, will take the voltage from a higher input source, and step it down to something lower.

This vacuum pressure is piped to the brake booster, also known as a vacuum servo.  This is basically a big can with a spring-loaded membrane in the center dividing it in half.  The piston that connects to the master brake cylinder is connected to this membrane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On one half of the brake booster is the stored vacuum.  On the other is a valve (normally closed) connecting to the atmosphere.  When the brake pedal is not pressed, the spring, vacuum on one side, and stored air on the other side equilibrate.  (In this equilibrium, the air side is &quot;stretched&quot; to a lower pressure.)  When the pedal is pressed, even a small amount, the valve is opened proportionally.  Atmospheric air rushes in and assists the foot in moving the piston forward.  When the foot is released, the spring is strong enough to return the piston and close the valve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By doing this, the car manufacturers can make the driver feel as if the only resistance to pressing the brake pedal is the spring.  The air/vacuum combination can counteract the required force to actuate the breaks.  Try pressing the brakes with the engine off.

The deck is the flat portion containing the roadway.  The length of the suspenders is carefully chosen so that the suspension cables hang in a catenary shape; the same shape they would hang in if unloaded.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These properties lead to some neat engineering tricks when designing suspension bridges:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Each tower is the same.

Rotation and torque amounts through the differential play a crucial part in these measurements, along with engine revs and engine torque; cylinder spark and valve timing (or firing), independent application of brakes and adjustment of the fuel supply to the engine (for fly-by-wire vehicles) are typically electronically adjusted in realtime in modern vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More sophisticated TC systems employ active differentials which sense the yaw of a vehicle during turns and can redistribute power to the drive wheels depending on road conditions, with the added benefit of allowing the EMS to calculate optimal slip angle for the outside tyres along with relative rotational speeds and control the redistribution of power. (Innermost wheels rotate more slowly than outer wheels when a car goes through a corner; simpler differentials on two-wheel drive vehicles only redistribute power across the drive wheels based on a purely mechanical operation.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The level of traction is measured tens or hundreds of times per second to allow the powertrain's management system (aka the EMS) to constantly adjust the level of power sent through the wheels irrespective of how leaden-footed the driver may be. TCS' operation is also similar to the operation of All Wheel / Four Wheel Drive where power is redistributed from the wheels experiencing low traction to ensure continued velocity and traction. (Audi's &quot;quattro&quot; system was the first successful widescale commercial implementation of an AWD system after its wildly successful debut in the eponymously named rallygoing &quot;Audi Quattro&quot;.) AWD vehicles also employ more complex differential and transaxle systems; this however falls outside the scope of this response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rear wheel drive vehicles and high-powered motorcycles benefit more from TCS than front wheel drive vehicles - by controlling excessive wheelspin and subsequent loss of drive (and resultant oversteer) in low-grip conditions it becomes useful as a safety feature and avoids the requirement to constantly modulate throttle input. The predecessor to TCS was the limited-slip differential, still common in many competitive vehicles as seen in British Touring Cars / German DTM and other hi-octane motorsports.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TCS engagement can be more obviously heard on high-powered motorsports vehicles like MotoGP motorbikes and pre-2009 Formula 1 cars (audible as brief spurts of white noise or distortion in the otherwise-regular engine tone) as the regular operation of the driveshaft, clutch and throttle are computer-compensated for the wheelspin. Usage in this scenario maximises drivetrain efficiency, wheel slip (for optimal traction) and application of power through corners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are numerous other factors additionally measured in more sophisticated combined systems, such as velocity, direction of travel, degrees of travel on the steering and amount of pressure applied to pedals. There is some crossover here with &quot;Electronic Stability Programme&quot; features on some cars such as BMWs; it is advisable to disable ESP (or enable 'Snow Mode' or a limited operation mode) on rear wheel drive vehicles as the TCS &amp;amp; ESP will by its nature cause a gradual loss of power to the drive wheels as it cannot understand the low-traction situation, instead interpreting it as an uncontrolled wheelspin or slide. ABS should always be disabled in snowy conditions as the system will continue to reduce braking power to the point where the vehicle is not being slowed down at all!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="129" LastEditorUserId="129" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-04-19T16:47:35.907" LastActivityDate="2011-04-19T16:47:35.907" CommentCount="1" />

When you want to turn left, you first turn the handlebars right. When you turn the handlebars to the right, traction with the ground causes the wheels to be pulled to the right. Now, your center of gravity is not above the wheels, you start to tip toward the left, and begin to turn to the left to keep yourself upright.

Bear with me if it takes a bit to get to the part of the answer that you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first technique is to use something called relative dating. This is a basic geologic tool that allows geologists to sort things by, essentially, how far down the geologic strata they are. Simply put, if you can look into the rock record and tell which end is up, you can say that the stuff put down more recently contains fossils that are younger than the stuff put down a long time ago. This is how geologists date fossils in the field, without the assistance of laboratory analysis, and is why we continue to use terms like the &quot;Cretaceous&quot; for identification, rather than just specifying the age of the fossil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second technique is called radiometric dating. This uses the radioactive decay of an element over time to determine the age of the object in question. This involves measuring the abundance of the parent (the isotope of the element that is decaying) and the daughter (the isotope of the element that it decays into) isotopes relative to some known standard, typically a non-radiogenic isotope (an isotope that is neither radioactive, nor a product of the decay of a different isotope) of the parent element, and then modeling the age of the object based on some known parameters - for example the initial abundance of the parent element in the object.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For things as young as many fossils, 14C decay is most frequently used because it has a half-life of about 5730 years (after about 5 half-lives the element is too scarce to accurately date the sample). 14C is a bit peculiar since the parent is continuously generated by the interaction of the Earth's atmosphere with solar radiation. This gives us some constraints on the abundance of 14C in an organism when it dies. For older fossils, other systems are used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The accuracy of several key variables changes the maximum precision on an age date. These variables include the half life (the time it takes for half of a parent isotope to decay away - often reported as a &quot;decay constant&quot; which has a mathematical relationship to the half-life), the initial abundance of the parent isotope, the initial abundance of the daughter isotope, and the degree of alteration the sample has experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="142" LastActivityDate="2011-04-20T01:47:50.710" CommentCount="1" />

For this the wing needs to be streamlined, so the flaps are retracted and mostly flush with the rest of the wing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At takeoff and landing, the aircraft will be going much slower, and the wing needs to provide much more &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_%28force%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;lift&lt;/a&gt; at the slower speed than its streamlined form can give.  So at these times the flaps are extended, effectively changing the shape of the wing to give more lift (by &quot;cupping&quot; the air more underneath the wing).  This has the negative effect of increasing the drag, so it takes more energy to push the airplane through the air with this less-streamlined wing form, but this lower efficiency is not as important for the short time the extra lift is needed.  (You may notice that in the very last phase of landing, the pilot increases the power to the engines, even though you are still descending; this is to counteract the increased drag from the extended flaps.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more detail, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_%28aircraft%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia's flap article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="139" LastActivityDate="2011-04-20T03:15:16.120" />

Stars further away look fainter because the light has spread out more before it gets to us. Since the light is spreading out into a sphere as we get 2x as far away the light appears 1/4 as bright. If we know how bright the star actually is (it's absolute magnitude) and measure how bright it appears (apparent magnitude) we can easily work out how far away it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We estimate how bright it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; is from it's temperature (from it's colour) and chemical signature but our best distance measuring tool at long distance are something called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cepheid variables&lt;/a&gt;. These stars vary in brightness over a few days, which is easy to measure, but importantly the time they take to change depends on their size which tells us their absolute magnitude.  So we simply measure their brightness as we see them, and how long it takes to vary - that tells us how bright they really are and we get the distance. As an extra bonus cepheids are very bright so we can see them in nearby galaxies&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the ultimate most distant objects we use the expansion of the universe. As the universe is expanding - everything appears to be moving away from us (important note - there is nothing special about where we are, if the whole universe is expanding then everything appears to move away from everything else).

Fortunately we can measure how fast something is moving from the Doppler shift of the spectral lines in it's light. We simply measure the wavelength of say Hydrogen line in a distant galaxy, work out how different that is from stationary Hydrogen in the lab and we have the speed - multiply by Hubble's constant and we have the distance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At very large distances there is a tricky bit about deciding what shape the universe is, since we can measure light emmitted when the universe was only 0.5M yr old and much smaller.

The means that at different altitudes, a different shape of bell is optimal. At sea level, ambient air pressure is at its highest, and so the bell can be very short and have a very wide angle, whereas in orbit, ambient pressure is almost nothing and so the optimum nozzle would be very long and have a very small flare angle.

Mostly it is temperature, but light cycle variations can also make trees think that it is the wrong time of year. Some years ago, I lived in an apartment building where one side of a tree in the courtyard had a spotlight shining on part of the tree (basically, it was shining on the sign but the tree had grown to obstruct part of the light). The part of the tree within the spotlight beam had leaves attempting to grow when the rest of the tree was dormant, and for the coldest part of the year, the tree would try to put out leaves.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Temperature levels change hormones in plants. It is a balancing act between the competing hormones that suppress growth and stimulate growth. The chilling will slow down the production of growth suppressing hormones until eventually the levels of growth stimulating hormones overwhelm them and buds appear. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Changes in the amount of light/darkness also change some hormone levels in plants. This is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoperiodism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;photoperiodism&lt;/a&gt;, and there are lots of examples of each type. In photoperiodism, certain parts of the photo receptors of the plant (the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochrome&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Phytochromes&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromophore&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chromophores&lt;/a&gt; are affected by light, and as the Chromophores absorb light, they cause the proteins they are part of to change. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochrome#Biochemistry&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;According to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, it is believed these changes trigger specific effects in the genes of the plant, causing the plant to change it's behavior:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Chemically, phytochrome consists of a&#xA;  chromophore, a single bilin molecule&#xA;  consisting of an open chain of four&#xA;  pyrrole rings, bonded to the protein&#xA;  moiety. It is the chromophore that&#xA;  absorbs light, and as a result changes&#xA;  the conformation of bilin and&#xA;  subsequently that of the attached&#xA;  protein, changing it from one state or&#xA;  isoform to the other [...] The Pfr&#xA;  state passes on a signal to other&#xA;  biological systems in the cell, such&#xA;  as the mechanisms responsible for gene&#xA;  expression. Although this mechanism is&#xA;  almost certainly a biochemical&#xA;  process, it is still the subject of&#xA;  much debate &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochrome#Biochemistry&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Temperate zone fruit trees have a chilling requirement, where the tree must spend X hours below Y temperature in order to successfully produce the buds that produce fruit in the following growing season. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/hil/hil-327.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This link&lt;/a&gt; has a table showing peach trees and the minimum number of hours they require below 45°F. This constrains where a tree may be grown to produce fruit. The northernmost counties of Florida are lucky to get 400 hours below 45°F each year, so most years a peach tree (a low chill variety) in Orlando would not produce flowers (and thus no peaches). Climate change will drastically change where crops can be grown because of the collision of chilling requirements with day/night time cycles (which control which latitudes plants can grow in). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Up here at these higher altitudes, many of the trees were bare and have only recently started growing leaves, weeks later than at lower elevations.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The drop in air pressure as you increase in altitude also drops air temperature.

The microfilters you need to install on every telephone socket before you plug in your modem (or Customer Premises Equipment) are lowpass filters - they separate voice frequencies and DSL frequencies (everything above 4kHz) and prevent 'crossover' between the two transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After filtering speech frequencies, this theoretically leaves ~255 'tones', channels of 4312.5Hz each, for DSL data. ADSL1 and ADSL2 employ a smaller frequency range than ADSL2+ and ADSL2+ with Annex M (which I will explain further); a more detailed breakdown of the frequencies used can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitz.co.uk/adsl/adsl_technology.htm#frequencies&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kitz's ADSL FAQ site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like ADSL1, with ADSL2+ the upstream channel starts at 25kHz and is carried in tones 5-31. However, tone 0 is not used, 1-5 are designated as POTS Guard Bands to avoid crosstalk and 16 is the Pilot Tone. As with ADSL1, ADSL2's downstream channel begins at 142.3kHz (tone 33) and continues up until the attenuation on the line worsens the SNR - the modem decides at which point it should stop attempting to use tones, and this is the basis of your &quot;sync speed&quot; with the exchange. ADSL2+ with Annex M (sometimes called &quot;upload plus&quot;), the upper limit of tones used for the upstream channel is increased from 31 to 56 (with the start tone for the downstream channel moved up accordingly) which provides for a theoretical increase in upstream speed from 1.3Mbps to 2.5Mbps under good conditions. As lower tones are less susceptible to interference or attenuation, a long line with Annex M will typically retain a disproportionately high upstream speed even if the downstream suffers through attenuation or loss.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the exchange (or CO) your modem communicates with a DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer, pronounced &quot;D-SLAM&quot;) - once your traffic is inside the exchange, it is typically passed onto your ISP's backhaul from the exchange to their core network, usually over fibre. With VDSL (sometimes known as FTTC) the DSLAM is just moved closer to your house, usually installed in green or grey street cabinets thereby shortening the length of copper between you and the equipment and providing the additional benefit of lower attenuation and higher sync speeds, which allows for a much greater throughput on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DSL suffers on long or poor quality lines - internal wiring is as important to maintain as external wiring (which in the UK is the property and responsibility of British Telecom). Any unshielded internal wiring will act as an antenna, picking up RF interference and likely also reducing the maximum achievable sync speed. For that reason, having the modem connected to the master socket by as short a run of cable as possible - then running longer ethernet cables to your destination - is a vastly preferable practice. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With regards to how DSL achieves such greater bandwidth, it's a combination of highly efficient error correction and encoding combined with the greater raw bandwidth utilised by the technology over standard analogue V.92 modems. ADSL employs both Reed-Solomon and Trellis Coded Modulation for different ranges of data to accommodate for line noise, interference and LOS. In the UK and some overseas countries, ADSL data is commonly transmitted inside &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitz.co.uk/adsl/data_transmission.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ATM cells&lt;/a&gt; as PPP frames - the protocol known as PPPoA (RFC 2364). PPPoA is also advantageous as the customer's router can be required to authenticate to the ISP's &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband_Remote_Access_Server&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;BRAS&lt;/a&gt; with a valid username and password prior to obtaining Internet access. The other advantage of using PPPoA encapsulation is that it provisions for Header Error Checking and Forward Error Checking (part of the interleaving technology) which further stabilises throughput on problematic lines. The other main protocol of data transmission is PPPoE, but explanation of this technology is beyond the scope of this answer. PPPoE is not commonly used in the UK due in part to historical reasons and also due to complexities arising from mixing the two standards on a national network. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitz.co.uk/adsl/interleaving.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Interleaving&lt;/a&gt; is usually applied by default to the data (which increases its resilience to interference, but raises the latency slightly). Clueful ISPs, at least in the UK, will disable interleaving upon request - putting the line into &quot;fastpath&quot; modem - which increases its susceptibility to LOS from interference but can almost halve the RTT, making a connection far better suited for VoIP or online gaming where low latency is very important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further reading: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kitz.co.uk/adsl/equip.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kitz.co.uk's ADSL FAQ pages&lt;/a&gt; for a lot of detailed information about many aspects of DSL, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Subscriber_Line&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; Wikipedia article for more on the DSL specification and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Subscriber_Line_Access_Multiplexer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for more on DSLAM equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="129" LastEditorUserId="129" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-04-21T13:37:13.363" LastActivityDate="2011-04-21T13:37:13.363" />

You can see that the peaks are somewhat haphazard, but the valleys are flat and precise.  Inside the lock, there are a series of (usually 4-7) stacks tiny metal cylinders which travel vertically.  These are called pins.  The pins fit into the valleys in your key.  Each pin is very roughly the diameter of a grain of rice, with a length of 2-8mm or so.  The pins are on springs so that they are normally pushed down, but when the key is inserted, the pins are raised up.  When they are all raised to the precisely correct level, the lock is allowed to turn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a normal lock, each stack of pins has two pins.  The one that touches the key is called the key pin.  When the tiny gap between the pins is raised to the &quot;shear line&quot; of the lock, that stack does not prevent the lock from turning.  When every stack is raised to the correct level, the lock can be opened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MASTER KEYED LOCKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a master key system, the stacks have more than two pins.

The master key is usually set up to use lower numbers; this prevents a user from filing down his change key into a master key.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(It is interesting to note that there are actually 16 keys that open each of these locks...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are other systems you can use too.  For example if we modify the first stack of the above three locks&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1,2] [1,5] [1,8] [1,4]&#xA;[1,2] [1,3] [1,3] [1,3]&#xA;[1,2] [1,6] [1,6] [1,6]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can see that 2111 is still a master key for these locks.  This allows multiple levels of security.  For example these three locks could be server closets, and you could give the building sysadmin the 2111 key.

Because the serum that contains these animal antibodies is itself a foreign substance, people can sometimes have an immediate or delayed allergic reaction to the anti-venom--so anti-venoms must be used with caution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Tangurena mentions, there are too many different mechanisms in different snake venoms for a single anti-body to be capable of neutralising all of them.  If you tried to produce a &quot;universal&quot; antibody which neutralised &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, or an anti-venom which contained a large number of different types of antibodies, then the person receiving it would likely die because of the impact of the anti-venom on their own body and immune system.

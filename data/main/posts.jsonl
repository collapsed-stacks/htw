There's one thing I wanted to add which others didn't mention: the core physics at work here.</p>\n\n<p>Friction is teh force between two objects as they try to move against each other, like your tires on the surface of the road. There's two kinds of friction: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction#Static_friction\" rel=\"nofollow\">Static Friction</a> which is between two objects that are not moving against each other, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction#Kinetic_friction\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kinetic Frictio</a> which occurs when the limit of static friction has been reached, and the two objects \"slip\".</p>\n\n<p>For an example, press your hands against each other firmly and try to slide them. Before they move the resistance you experience is static friction. Once you apply enough force, you exceed the maximum force of static friction and they slip. Now the resistance is less: this is kinetic friction.</p>\n\n<p>When your tires are on the road's surface, the wheels turn at the same rate as the vehicle is moving, and the part of the tire in contact with the road is (hopefully) static. If you don't have ABS and you slam on the brakes, the force of the friction of the brakes may exceed the force of the static friction between your tires and the road -- especially on icy or wet roads. When this happens your tires will completely stop, yet your vehicle will keep going. Now, your tires only have the force of kinetic friction on the road -- they have\"locked up\", and you have much less control because the force exerted by steering is far less.</p>\n\n<p>ABS detects the motion of the wheels relative to the motion of the vehicle, and prevents the wheels from locking up by releasing the force of the brakes when it detects lockup. This is why you feel your brake pedal push back at you when this happens. This is also why you're told to \"pump\" your breaks if you <strong>do not</strong> have ABS. It's all about keeping the much higher force of static friction.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 20, "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-18T21:10:56.530", "CommentCount": 4}

This massive displacement of water is what ultimately causes a tsunami -- that displaced water moves with such a high force (about 600MPH) in open ocean, and when it reaches the shore, the wave will crest with massive destructive force.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 28, "LastEditorUserId": 20, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-04-21T21:57:33.310", "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-21T21:57:33.310"}

The frequencies at which cellular towers operate varies between wireless providers, whose phones have programming to listen for only their specific frequencies.  These frequencies are shared by the phones, and those phones each have an individual identification code of some type (this varies between cellular providers) which the tower detects, and then, similarly to the way that your computer communicates on the internet, the communication of data is transferred to your device and the cellular towers.  The identification codes (along with your cell phone's number) are used in the communication of the data between phone-and-tower, which is how your signals do not get mixed up with the signals of another phone.</p>\n\n<p>Wireless computer signals operate under similar contexts, however there are several additional concerns.  Wireless signals for routers all operate with a base frequency of 2.4GHz.  The various wireless standards (B / G / N) each operate with different channels, which are just minor offsets of the 2.4GHz frequency, however the frequency of a channel never goes beyond 2.5GHz.

This information is stored in the router, which has its own hardware identification code, as well as an ID on the internet (an IP address) which establishes the starting point of data transmission, and is utilized by your router to identify incoming data (and outgoing data) as being destined to your computer.  Similarly, routers and internet hubs around the world will act as junction points between your internet and the site or location of your information that you are requesting.  The communication at the destination end is similar to the communication between your router and your computer, except that the destination is typically one box rather than a router-to-computer system.  The data is sent back from the remote system, follows the steps that the data took to get to itself, and the data ends back up at your router, which in turn identifies the information from the remote source, and knows that your computer requested it.  This information is sent from your router back to your computer, where the various data (which is in tiny segments of information called \"packets\") is reassembled in order by your computer.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 78, "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-19T00:57:40.367", "CommentCount": 2}

The simplest logic gate is an inverter (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOT_gate\" rel=\"nofollow\">NOT gate</a>), which takes one logical signal at its input and produces the opposite signal at its output (0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0).

Common examples are the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate\" rel=\"nofollow\">AND gate</a> (which outputs a logical 1 only when <em>all</em> of its inputs are 1) and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OR_gate\" rel=\"nofollow\">OR gate</a> (which outputs a logical 1 if <em>any</em> of its inputs are 1).</p>\n\n<p>In a typical silicon chip, logic gates are built using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor\" rel=\"nofollow\">transistors</a>, which are essentially tiny switches that use one electrical signal to turn another electrical signal on &amp; off.

Eight bits are usually called a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte\" rel=\"nofollow\">byte</a>, and most CPUs deal with numbers that are two, four, or eight bytes long (16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture\" rel=\"nofollow\">architecture</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Every CPU has its own \"language\" which we call <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code\" rel=\"nofollow\">machine code</a>.

The piston that connects to the master brake cylinder is connected to this membrane.</p>\n\n<p>On one half of the brake booster is the stored vacuum.  On the other is a valve (normally closed) connecting to the atmosphere.  When the brake pedal is not pressed, the spring, vacuum on one side, and stored air on the other side equilibrate.  (In this equilibrium, the air side is \"stretched\" to a lower pressure.)  When the pedal is pressed, even a small amount, the valve is opened proportionally.

The air/vacuum combination can counteract the required force to actuate the breaks.  Try pressing the brakes with the engine off.

Rotation and torque amounts through the differential play a crucial part in these measurements, along with engine revs and engine torque; cylinder spark and valve timing (or firing), independent application of brakes and adjustment of the fuel supply to the engine (for fly-by-wire vehicles) are typically electronically adjusted in realtime in modern vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>More sophisticated TC systems employ active differentials which sense the yaw of a vehicle during turns and can redistribute power to the drive wheels depending on road conditions, with the added benefit of allowing the EMS to calculate optimal slip angle for the outside tyres along with relative rotational speeds and control the redistribution of power. (Innermost wheels rotate more slowly than outer wheels when a car goes through a corner; simpler differentials on two-wheel drive vehicles only redistribute power across the drive wheels based on a purely mechanical operation.)</p>\n\n<p>The level of traction is measured tens or hundreds of times per second to allow the powertrain's management system (aka the EMS) to constantly adjust the level of power sent through the wheels irrespective of how leaden-footed the driver may be. TCS' operation is also similar to the operation of All Wheel / Four Wheel Drive where power is redistributed from the wheels experiencing low traction to ensure continued velocity and traction. (Audi's \"quattro\" system was the first successful widescale commercial implementation of an AWD system after its wildly successful debut in the eponymously named rallygoing \"Audi Quattro\".) AWD vehicles also employ more complex differential and transaxle systems; this however falls outside the scope of this response.</p>\n\n<p>Rear wheel drive vehicles and high-powered motorcycles benefit more from TCS than front wheel drive vehicles - by controlling excessive wheelspin and subsequent loss of drive (and resultant oversteer) in low-grip conditions it becomes useful as a safety feature and avoids the requirement to constantly modulate throttle input. The predecessor to TCS was the limited-slip differential, still common in many competitive vehicles as seen in British Touring Cars / German DTM and other hi-octane motorsports.</p>\n\n<p>TCS engagement can be more obviously heard on high-powered motorsports vehicles like MotoGP motorbikes and pre-2009 Formula 1 cars (audible as brief spurts of white noise or distortion in the otherwise-regular engine tone) as the regular operation of the driveshaft, clutch and throttle are computer-compensated for the wheelspin. Usage in this scenario maximises drivetrain efficiency, wheel slip (for optimal traction) and application of power through corners.</p>\n\n<p>There are numerous other factors additionally measured in more sophisticated combined systems, such as velocity, direction of travel, degrees of travel on the steering and amount of pressure applied to pedals. There is some crossover here with \"Electronic Stability Programme\" features on some cars such as BMWs; it is advisable to disable ESP (or enable 'Snow Mode' or a limited operation mode) on rear wheel drive vehicles as the TCS &amp; ESP will by its nature cause a gradual loss of power to the drive wheels as it cannot understand the low-traction situation, instead interpreting it as an uncontrolled wheelspin or slide. ABS should always be disabled in snowy conditions as the system will continue to reduce braking power to the point where the vehicle is not being slowed down at all!</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 129, "LastEditorUserId": 129, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-04-19T16:47:35.907", "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-19T16:47:35.907", "CommentCount": 1}

Bear with me if it takes a bit to get to the part of the answer that you're looking for.</p>\n\n<p>The first technique is to use something called relative dating. This is a basic geologic tool that allows geologists to sort things by, essentially, how far down the geologic strata they are. Simply put, if you can look into the rock record and tell which end is up, you can say that the stuff put down more recently contains fossils that are younger than the stuff put down a long time ago. This is how geologists date fossils in the field, without the assistance of laboratory analysis, and is why we continue to use terms like the \"Cretaceous\" for identification, rather than just specifying the age of the fossil.</p>\n\n<p>The second technique is called radiometric dating. This uses the radioactive decay of an element over time to determine the age of the object in question. This involves measuring the abundance of the parent (the isotope of the element that is decaying) and the daughter (the isotope of the element that it decays into) isotopes relative to some known standard, typically a non-radiogenic isotope (an isotope that is neither radioactive, nor a product of the decay of a different isotope) of the parent element, and then modeling the age of the object based on some known parameters - for example the initial abundance of the parent element in the object.</p>\n\n<p>For things as young as many fossils, 14C decay is most frequently used because it has a half-life of about 5730 years (after about 5 half-lives the element is too scarce to accurately date the sample). 14C is a bit peculiar since the parent is continuously generated by the interaction of the Earth's atmosphere with solar radiation. This gives us some constraints on the abundance of 14C in an organism when it dies. For older fossils, other systems are used.</p>\n\n<p>The accuracy of several key variables changes the maximum precision on an age date. These variables include the half life (the time it takes for half of a parent isotope to decay away - often reported as a \"decay constant\" which has a mathematical relationship to the half-life), the initial abundance of the parent isotope, the initial abundance of the daughter isotope, and the degree of alteration the sample has experienced.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 142, "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-20T01:47:50.710", "CommentCount": 1}

These stars vary in brightness over a few days, which is easy to measure, but importantly the time they take to change depends on their size which tells us their absolute magnitude.

The means that at different altitudes, a different shape of bell is optimal. At sea level, ambient air pressure is at its highest, and so the bell can be very short and have a very wide angle, whereas in orbit, ambient pressure is almost nothing and so the optimum nozzle would be very long and have a very small flare angle. (look how long the nozzles on <a href=\"http://www.hightechscience.org/Buran_Space_Shuttle_Comparsion_1.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">shuttle and its booster rockets</a>, the shuttle nozzles are much longer because they are designed for higher altitudes)</p>\n\n<p>An aerospike however is what is called an <em>altitude compensating nozzle</em>. How it works is that that the air pressure around the jet influences how much it can expand and therefore effectively changes the size of the nozzle as the rocket gains height. Through recirculation below the wedge of the spike, the two jets heat the air, increasing the pressure in a place that would other have an vacuum (by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bernoulli's law</a>), the net effect of which is an area of roughly atmospheric pressure, which balances the normal air pressure on top of the rocket, meaning there is no <em>disadvantage</em> to having the spike at sea level. At high altitude this higher pressure actually increases the thrust to the rocket, and the decreased air pressure surrounding the jet, has the same effect of a larger nozzle, also contributing to the compensating effect.

So some argue that the gains from the aerospike design are wiped out straight away by the energy required to stop it melting.</li>\n</ol>\n", "OwnerUserId": 39, "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-20T15:11:45.857", "CommentCount": 1}

Nearly all systems use the DOCSIS standard for cable internet(Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) Each regular channel(not compressed through digital MPEG encoders) only take up around 6MhZ each. This can further be reduced with a digital box that decodes M-PEG streams to fit more into a 6MhZ slice. In cable the 5-65MhZ is set for upstream data, and 850-1000MhZ is for down stream.

The part of the tree within the spotlight beam had leaves attempting to grow when the rest of the tree was dormant, and for the coldest part of the year, the tree would try to put out leaves.  </p>\n\n<p>Temperature levels change hormones in plants.

This is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoperiodism\" rel=\"nofollow\">photoperiodism</a>, and there are lots of examples of each type. In photoperiodism, certain parts of the photo receptors of the plant (the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochrome\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phytochromes</a> called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromophore\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chromophores</a> are affected by light, and as the Chromophores absorb light, they cause the proteins they are part of to change. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochrome#Biochemistry\" rel=\"nofollow\">According to Wikipedia</a>, it is believed these changes trigger specific effects in the genes of the plant, causing the plant to change it's behavior:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Chemically, phytochrome consists of a\n  chromophore, a single bilin molecule\n  consisting of an open chain of four\n  pyrrole rings, bonded to the protein\n  moiety. It is the chromophore that\n  absorbs light, and as a result changes\n  the conformation of bilin and\n  subsequently that of the attached\n  protein, changing it from one state or\n  isoform to the other [...] The Pfr\n  state passes on a signal to other\n  biological systems in the cell, such\n  as the mechanisms responsible for gene\n  expression. Although this mechanism is\n  almost certainly a biochemical\n  process, it is still the subject of\n  much debate <sup><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochrome#Biochemistry\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Temperate zone fruit trees have a chilling requirement, where the tree must spend X hours below Y temperature in order to successfully produce the buds that produce fruit in the following growing season. <a href=\"http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/hil/hil-327.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">This link</a> has a table showing peach trees and the minimum number of hours they require below 45\u00b0F. This constrains where a tree may be grown to produce fruit. The northernmost counties of Florida are lucky to get 400 hours below 45\u00b0F each year, so most years a peach tree (a low chill variety) in Orlando would not produce flowers (and thus no peaches). Climate change will drastically change where crops can be grown because of the collision of chilling requirements with day/night time cycles (which control which latitudes plants can grow in). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Up here at these higher altitudes, many of the trees were bare and have only recently started growing leaves, weeks later than at lower elevations.</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The drop in air pressure as you increase in altitude also drops air temperature.

This is equivalent to being about 200 miles north per half mile of altitude.

The microfilters you need to install on every telephone socket before you plug in your modem (or Customer Premises Equipment) are lowpass filters - they separate voice frequencies and DSL frequencies (everything above 4kHz) and prevent 'crossover' between the two transmissions.</p>\n\n<p>After filtering speech frequencies, this theoretically leaves ~255 'tones', channels of 4312.5Hz each, for DSL data. ADSL1 and ADSL2 employ a smaller frequency range than ADSL2+ and ADSL2+ with Annex M (which I will explain further); a more detailed breakdown of the frequencies used can be found on <a href=\"http://www.kitz.co.uk/adsl/adsl_technology.htm#frequencies\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kitz's ADSL FAQ site</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Like ADSL1, with ADSL2+ the upstream channel starts at 25kHz and is carried in tones 5-31. However, tone 0 is not used, 1-5 are designated as POTS Guard Bands to avoid crosstalk and 16 is the Pilot Tone. As with ADSL1, ADSL2's downstream channel begins at 142.3kHz (tone 33) and continues up until the attenuation on the line worsens the SNR - the modem decides at which point it should stop attempting to use tones, and this is the basis of your \"sync speed\" with the exchange. ADSL2+ with Annex M (sometimes called \"upload plus\"), the upper limit of tones used for the upstream channel is increased from 31 to 56 (with the start tone for the downstream channel moved up accordingly) which provides for a theoretical increase in upstream speed from 1.3Mbps to 2.5Mbps under good conditions. As lower tones are less susceptible to interference or attenuation, a long line with Annex M will typically retain a disproportionately high upstream speed even if the downstream suffers through attenuation or loss.</p>\n\n<p>At the exchange (or CO) your modem communicates with a DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer, pronounced \"D-SLAM\") - once your traffic is inside the exchange, it is typically passed onto your ISP's backhaul from the exchange to their core network, usually over fibre. With VDSL (sometimes known as FTTC) the DSLAM is just moved closer to your house, usually installed in green or grey street cabinets thereby shortening the length of copper between you and the equipment and providing the additional benefit of lower attenuation and higher sync speeds, which allows for a much greater throughput on the line.</p>\n\n<p>DSL suffers on long or poor quality lines - internal wiring is as important to maintain as external wiring (which in the UK is the property and responsibility of British Telecom). Any unshielded internal wiring will act as an antenna, picking up RF interference and likely also reducing the maximum achievable sync speed. For that reason, having the modem connected to the master socket by as short a run of cable as possible - then running longer ethernet cables to your destination - is a vastly preferable practice. </p>\n\n<p>With regards to how DSL achieves such greater bandwidth, it's a combination of highly efficient error correction and encoding combined with the greater raw bandwidth utilised by the technology over standard analogue V.92 modems. ADSL employs both Reed-Solomon and Trellis Coded Modulation for different ranges of data to accommodate for line noise, interference and LOS. In the UK and some overseas countries, ADSL data is commonly transmitted inside <a href=\"http://www.kitz.co.uk/adsl/data_transmission.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">ATM cells</a> as PPP frames - the protocol known as PPPoA (RFC 2364). PPPoA is also advantageous as the customer's router can be required to authenticate to the ISP's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband_Remote_Access_Server\" rel=\"nofollow\">BRAS</a> with a valid username and password prior to obtaining Internet access. The other advantage of using PPPoA encapsulation is that it provisions for Header Error Checking and Forward Error Checking (part of the interleaving technology) which further stabilises throughput on problematic lines. The other main protocol of data transmission is PPPoE, but explanation of this technology is beyond the scope of this answer. PPPoE is not commonly used in the UK due in part to historical reasons and also due to complexities arising from mixing the two standards on a national network. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kitz.co.uk/adsl/interleaving.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Interleaving</a> is usually applied by default to the data (which increases its resilience to interference, but raises the latency slightly). Clueful ISPs, at least in the UK, will disable interleaving upon request - putting the line into \"fastpath\" modem - which increases its susceptibility to LOS from interference but can almost halve the RTT, making a connection far better suited for VoIP or online gaming where low latency is very important.</p>\n\n<p>Further reading: <a href=\"http://www.kitz.co.uk/adsl/equip.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kitz.co.uk's ADSL FAQ pages</a> for a lot of detailed information about many aspects of DSL, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Subscriber_Line\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> Wikipedia article for more on the DSL specification and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Subscriber_Line_Access_Multiplexer\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> for more on DSLAM equipment.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 129, "LastEditorUserId": 129, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-04-21T13:37:13.363", "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-21T13:37:13.363"}

As such, more than one valley height is acceptable for each position along the key.</p>\n\n<p>If you had the following set of 4-pin locks (I am using [x,y] to mean a pin stack that can be opened by a key cut to either x or y at that location):</p>\n\n<pre><code>[1,2] [1,5] [1,8] [1,4]\n[1,3] [1,3] [1,3] [1,3]\n[1,6] [1,6] [1,6] [1,6]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can see that the 1111 key opens all three locks, and the keys 2584, 3333, and 6666 are the \"change keys\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>That's it</strong> - what follows is merely hobby. :)</p>\n\n<p>A 9 represents the deepest cut, and a 0 or 1 is the shallowest cut.  The master key is usually set up to use lower numbers; this prevents a user from filing down his change key into a master key.</p>\n\n<p>(It is interesting to note that there are actually 16 keys that open each of these locks...)</p>\n\n<p>There are other systems you can use too.  For example if we modify the first stack of the above three locks</p>\n\n<pre><code>[1,2] [1,5] [1,8] [1,4]\n[1,2] [1,3] [1,3] [1,3]\n[1,2] [1,6] [1,6] [1,6]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can see that 2111 is still a master key for these locks.  This allows multiple levels of security.  For example these three locks could be server closets, and you could give the building sysadmin the 2111 key.  However, you could give the head of facilities the 1111 key which would open every door in the building.</p>\n\n<p>This is great because it allows you to have cascaded security systems without needing more than 2 levels in any stack.  The more levels, the more expensive the lock is to produce and maintain, and the easier it is to pick (imagine if every level was a valid level...)</p>\n\n<p>Also cheaper to build is a system like this.</p>\n\n<pre><code>[1] [1] [1] [1,4]\n[1] [1] [1] [1,3]\n[1] [1] [1] [1,6]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you have every worked/lived in a master-keyed system, you may find that the first section of your key (near the hilt) is the same as your coworkers/dorm-mates.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 59, "LastEditorUserId": 59, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-04-22T07:35:20.883", "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-22T07:35:20.883", "CommentCount": 1}

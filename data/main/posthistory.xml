Parallax arises from the fact that you have two eyes, and they are separated by some space, hence each eye sees a slightly different image from the other eye. The brain uses this information to produce the sensation you know as depth perception. To simulate 3D, you have to trick your eyes in seeing two slightly different images, which the brain reconstruct as 3D. Of course, what is seen by one eye must not be seen by the other eye. One trivial way was to add filters in front of each eye, such as colored or polarized lenses. Another approach was using liquid crystal glasses whose lenses switch from black to transparent quickly and synchronized with the projector. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The 3D displays without glasses use different tricks to achieve the same goal, using [parallax barriers][1] (a physical grid positioned ad-hoc) and [lenticular autostereoscopy][2] (the same concept, with using lenses instead of a physical barrier).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Autostereoscopy][3]&#xD;&#xA;[image credits][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One disadvantage of this technique is that it halves the horizontal resolution, and the position of the observer is absolutely critical for a good 3D effect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_barrier&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereoscopic_display&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.imgur.com/n6TVS.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Parallax_barrier_vs_lenticular_screen.svg" />

There's one thing I wanted to add which others didn't mention: the core physics at work here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Friction is teh force between two objects as they try to move against each other, like your tires on the surface of the road. There's two kinds of friction: [Static Friction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction#Static_friction) which is between two objects that are not moving against each other, and [Kinetic Frictio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction#Kinetic_friction) which occurs when the limit of static friction has been reached, and the two objects &quot;slip&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For an example, press your hands against each other firmly and try to slide them. Before they move the resistance you experience is static friction. Once you apply enough force, you exceed the maximum force of static friction and they slip. Now the resistance is less: this is kinetic friction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When your tires are on the road's surface, the wheels turn at the same rate as the vehicle is moving, and the part of the tire in contact with the road is (hopefully) static. If you don't have ABS and you slam on the brakes, the force of the friction of the brakes may exceed the force of the static friction between your tires and the road -- especially on icy or wet roads. When this happens your tires will completely stop, yet your vehicle will keep going. Now, your tires only have the force of kinetic friction on the road -- they have&quot;locked up&quot;, and you have much less control because the force exerted by steering is far less.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ABS detects the motion of the wheels relative to the motion of the vehicle, and prevents the wheels from locking up by releasing the force of the brakes when it detects lockup. This is why you feel your brake pedal push back at you when this happens. This is also why you're told to &quot;pump&quot; your breaks if you **do not** have ABS. It's all about keeping the much higher force of static friction." />

After the hot gas has run through a radiator coil in the back (or bottom) with air blown over it to release as much of the heat as conduction can, it comes to the compressor which uses mechanical energy to compress the gas down to a liquid, which cools it (by dumping lots of heat via the compressor).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then there is a teeny device that is simply a small thin tube on one side, and a bigger tube on the other, and as the gas passes through it, it expands, and absorbs heat, as to expand the gas needs heat.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus it sucks the heat out of the fridge (or the air blown over it) to get passed back to the radiator coil to dump as much heat as possible, and then the compressor to start the cycle again." />

Energy saving bulbs do use less power than normal light bulbs, and are more efficient in how they do it. They are the same technology that is in the kind of strip lights you see in shops and offices. The reason some people say you should leave the room after breaking one is that many of them contain hazardous elements like mercury, which can be damaging to your health. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The real place we will save lots of energy in lighting is when LED technology is mature. When the push to move to CF bulbs started, LED lighting was recognised as a lot more efficient again, but the technology was no where near ready. Now that LEDs are almost ready to be used in the home (they are almost cheap enough to provide the same amount of light as an old style bulb) we have the problem that many countries have already jumped on the CF bandwagon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;CF lighting works in roughly the same way as neon sign lighting, electrons are passed through a tube full of gas exciting it to release light. Old style iridescent bulbs work by passing current through a wire which glows and gives off light (and a lot of heat). LED lights work by exciting electrons directly and making them jump an energy gap to give off light.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The bottom line is that while CF lights are more efficient than normal bulbs, they also contain a lot of nasty materials and they last a bit longer but not more than around an order of magnitude.

A spinning top (or any spinning mass, for that matter) tends to keep spinning unless some other force acts on it. When the top starts to tip in one direction (due to slight weight imbalance or an uneven surface, for example), this applies a small [torque][2] (a sideways force) to the top. For a stationary top, this force would contine to act until the top falls over. The &quot;magic&quot; of a spinning top is that the small sideways torque is converted into a [precession][3] (a wobble around the spinning axis). As long as the top is spinning fast enough, the wobble remains small and the top will not fall over. Eventually, when the spinning slows down enough (due to fricton), the wobble becomes too great and the top will fall.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum#Conservation_of_angular_momentum&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precess" />

The spark gap essentially discharges all of the capacitor into the inductor which stores that energy in a magnetic field, which induces voltage into the secondary coil.&#xD;&#xA;One the capacitor is empty the energy reverses back charging up the capacitor some, and this process continues diminishing the power until the spark gap can no longer be maintained. This then allows the capactior to be fully recharged and the process can begin again. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whats also important here is to note that the Toroid on top of the secondary coil acts like a capactior between the coil and the ground, allowing the secondary circuit to gain resonance with the primary. This then actually allows the power to increase when the primary circuits magnetic field charges transfering some more power to the secondary coil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hopefully this wall of text is helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.imgur.com/YITn4.png&#xD;&#xA;A quick google image search of the idea gave me this picture that shows essentially what I was refering to. &#xD;&#xA;I am linking this pic from a website named sciencebrothers.org." />

This works as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. You log in to site A (identity provider)&#xD;&#xA;2. You go to site B (identity consumer). It asks you for your identity. &#xD;&#xA;3. You say &quot;ask site A via OpenID&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;4. Site B redirects the request to site A.

Site B registers you as &quot;user@siteA&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that B relies on A to provide true info - i.e., if A lies about the user, B has no way to know it, so you should only accept OAuth providers that you trust if you rely on their data. However, if you just use it as unique name, it's OK to accept any OpenID provider.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[OAuth][2] is a way to give people (or sites) permissions on certain site without giving them full access and revealing passwords, etc. - e.g., allowing a printing site to access particular image in your photo hosting without giving out your username and password. It works this way:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. You ask consumer site C to print your photo from provider P.&#xD;&#xA;2. Site C calls special URL on P and gets a token (random string) called &quot;request token&quot; (RT). &#xD;&#xA;3. Site C redirects browser request to specific resource on P and uses token RT to cryptographically sign it, so P knows that the request comes from C since it issued RT to C. &#xD;&#xA;4. Site P displays login form to the user and makes the user identify himself. &#xD;&#xA;5. Once user is logged in, the site asks &quot;do you approve allowing site C to access this resource&quot;?&#xD;&#xA;6. If you approve, P generates &quot;authorization token&quot; AT and redirects back to specified URL at C with this token.&#xD;&#xA;7. C saves the token AT and now can use it to access the specified resource without the user needing to log in again or to give it any access details.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that the user never gave any details to site C and only asked it to access the specific resource on the site - so if C wanted to access something else it would be denied since the token AT tells site P that it has access for specific resource (unless P issued token that allows access to all - it's up to P to define permissions for each token). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also the OAuth protocol makes C use its own unique key and generate unique requests with timestamps, so if somebody listened to the request it could not replay it again since P would recognize that it already saw this unique request or because the timestamp is too old, and if someone wanted to fake request from C it wouldn't be able to since it doesn't have C's unique key. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oauth" />

They are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* AC &#xD;&#xA;* DC step down&#xD;&#xA;* AC to DC&#xD;&#xA;* DC to AC&#xD;&#xA;* DC step up&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AC Voltage transformers are essentially pairs of electromagnets, one contained entirely inside the other, which have different winding lengths. The net effect of these dual magnets is that the current coming out from the output line is some multiple of what the input line is, and as power is conserved, the voltage must also be half. A transformer which is not connected to a load will still draw power. These transformations can be lossless, although small losses are common.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;DC step down, or more commonly, [Voltage dividers][2], will take the voltage from a higher input source, and step it down to something lower. One of the simplest ways to do so is from a bridge circuit, although more advanced ways work using an op amp. There is an article from [analog Devices][3] which explains how one can be used, including pictures. These transformation involve a small to moderate loss of power.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AC to DC transformation is accomplished usually in 2 steps, listed below. They typically involve significant (~50%) power losses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. [Rectify][4] the signal&#xD;&#xA;2. Use a low pass filter on the remaining signal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;DC to AC transformation works much the reverse of AC to DC transformation, and are similarly inefficient. Namely, the steps are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. [Invert][5] the signal.&#xD;&#xA;2. Run the signal through a high pass filter, notched at the desired frequency.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;DC step up transformers typically work in a 3 step process, and are very inefficient.

The frequencies at which cellular towers operate varies between wireless providers, whose phones have programming to listen for only their specific frequencies.  These frequencies are shared by the phones, and those phones each have an individual identification code of some type (this varies between cellular providers) which the tower detects, and then, similarly to the way that your computer communicates on the internet, the communication of data is transferred to your device and the cellular towers.  The identification codes (along with your cell phone's number) are used in the communication of the data between phone-and-tower, which is how your signals do not get mixed up with the signals of another phone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wireless computer signals operate under similar contexts, however there are several additional concerns.  Wireless signals for routers all operate with a base frequency of 2.4GHz.  The various wireless standards (B / G / N) each operate with different channels, which are just minor offsets of the 2.4GHz frequency, however the frequency of a channel never goes beyond 2.5GHz.  This image courtesy of Wikipedia has a decent visual explanation of the differences of channels across the various wireless internet standards:  &#xD;&#xA;![Wireless Channels][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Along similar lines as that of phones, wireless computing devices have individual hardware identification codes, called MAC addresses, which identifies to a router your individual network device.  This information is stored in the router, which has its own hardware identification code, as well as an ID on the internet (an IP address) which establishes the starting point of data transmission, and is utilized by your router to identify incoming data (and outgoing data) as being destined to your computer.  Similarly, routers and internet hubs around the world will act as junction points between your internet and the site or location of your information that you are requesting.  The communication at the destination end is similar to the communication between your router and your computer, except that the destination is typically one box rather than a router-to-computer system.  The data is sent back from the remote system, follows the steps that the data took to get to itself, and the data ends back up at your router, which in turn identifies the information from the remote source, and knows that your computer requested it.  This information is sent from your router back to your computer, where the various data (which is in tiny segments of information called &quot;packets&quot;) is reassembled in order by your computer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.imgur.com/IiFyo.png" />

Certain materials (usually quartz crystal) generate a voltage when pressure is applied to them.  A mass can be placed next to a crystal, and the force can be indirectly measured.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3) Control loop.  In some critical applications, such as steering a missile, the acceleration must be known precisely.  A magnet on a spring can be suspended inside an electromagnetic coil.  Using a sensor and a closed loop control system, a dynamic current can be run through the coil, exactly the right amount to keep the mass still.  The amount of current required gives you the acceleration of the device.  This system does not suffer from the effects of nonlinearities under extreme acceleration." />

Together, these subsystems can be programmed to perform complex calculations. Each subsystem is composed of many (thousands, perhaps millions) of digital logic gates.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Digital logic gates are simple electronic circuits that use electrical voltage to define a simple digital state. A low voltage (typically zero) is used to represent a logical 0, while a higher voltage is used to represent a logical 1. The simplest logic gate is an *inverter* or NOT gate, which reverses the logical signal at its input (0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0). Other, more complex gates take two or more input signals and output specific signals depending on the values of all input signals. Common examples are the AND gate (which outputs a 1 only if *all* of its inputs are 1) and the OR gate (which outputs a 1 if *any* of its inputs are 1). In a typical silicon chip, each logic gate is composed of several transistors, which are tiny devices that use one electrical signal to turn another electrical signal on &amp; off.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Digital logic gates can be combined to perform basic mathematical calculations. In the digital world, numbers are represented in *binary*, or &quot;base two&quot;. We normally think of numbers in &quot;base ten&quot;, which means that you have ten numbers (&quot;zero&quot; to &quot;nine&quot;) which are combined to form larger numbers. In &quot;base ten&quot;, the number 234 means 2x(10)^2 (two hundred) plus 3x(10)^1 (thirty) plus 4x(10)^0 (four). The same number in base 2 would be 11101010 which means 1x(2)^7 plus 1x(2)^6 plus 1x(2)^5 plus 0x(2)^4 plus 1x(2)^3 plus 0x(2)^2 plus 1x(2)^1 plus 0x(2)^0. A collection of eight binary digits can represent any number between 0 and 255. Eight binary bits are called a *byte*, and most CPUs deal with numbers that are two, four, or eight bytes long (16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit, respectively).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Every CPU has its own &quot;language&quot; which we call &quot;machine code&quot;. This &quot;language&quot; uses binary numbers to represent instructions that can be performed by the CPU. Higher level programming languages like Assembly, C, C++, Java, Objective-C can be used to program a CPU, but when they are compiled, the result is always machine code. Java uses one more in-between step (the JVM), but that is a matter for a whole other answer." />

This vacuum pressure is piped to the brake booster, also known as a vacuum servo.  This is basically a big can with a spring-loaded membrane in the center dividing it in half.  The piston that connects to the master brake cylinder is connected to this membrane.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On one half of the brake booster is the stored vacuum.  On the other is a valve (normally closed) connecting to the atmosphere.  When the brake pedal is not pressed, the spring, vacuum on one side, and stored air on the other side equilibrate.  (In this equilibrium, the air side is &quot;stretched&quot; to a lower pressure.)  When the pedal is pressed, even a small amount, the valve is opened proportionally.  Atmospheric air rushes in and assists the foot in moving the piston forward.  When the foot is released, the spring is strong enough to return the piston and close the valve.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By doing this, the car manufacturers can make the driver feel as if the only resistance to pressing the brake pedal is the spring.  The air/vacuum combination can counteract the required force to actuate the breaks.  Try pressing the brakes with the engine off.  They still work, but you have to press harder to see the same amount of pedal movement." />

[Inductive coupling][1] occurs when two wires are placed close to each-other, so that a current flowing in one wire will *induce* a current in the second wire by way of the magnetic field. This is the exact same principle used in power transformers. The efficiency of the transfer (i.e. the amount of current produced in the &quot;target&quot; wire versus the amount of current sent through the &quot;source&quot; wire) is dependent on:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. how close the two wires are together (the closer the better)&#xD;&#xA;2. how long the wires are (the longer the better)&#xD;&#xA;3. the geometry of the wires (coils tend to work better)&#xD;&#xA;4. the resonant frequency of each coil (matched coils are better)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Inductive charging][2] makes use of inductive coupling to produce current in a coil of wire inside the battery-powered device by creating a charging current in a coil of wire near that device.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [0]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_coupling&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging" />

The towers must be very strong vertically, but they do not need to resist bending, as all the force applied is straight down.  As such they are often very thin when viewed from the side.&#xD;&#xA; - The large cables which connect to the top of the pillars are called suspension cables.  The cables also connect to anchoring points on land on either side of the bridge.&#xD;&#xA; - Vertical suspender cables (sometimes rods) are hung from the suspension cables down to the deck.  The deck is the flat portion containing the roadway.  The length of the suspenders is carefully chosen so that the suspension cables hang in a catenary shape; the same shape they would hang in if unloaded.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These properties lead to some neat engineering tricks when designing suspension bridges:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Each tower is the same.  Even in a many-tower bridge, the forces on each tower are exactly the same, as each has to support only the cables extending from each side.  These cables all have the same tension and angle at the point where they meet the tower.&#xD;&#xA; - The cables and deck can be modeled as &quot;really heavy cables.&quot;  Because the cables still hang in the catenary shape, and the weight of the deck is distributed evenly, the force on the towers is identical to what it would be for a certain (extremely) high cable mass.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a variety of engineering advantages to suspension bridges, notably the ability to span larger distances and resist earthquakes more effectively.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Each of these subsystem is composed of [many][1.4] digital [logic gates][1.3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Digital logic gates are electronic circuits that use an electrical voltage to define simple logical states. A low voltage (typically zero) is used to represent a logical &quot;0&quot;, while a higher voltage is used to represent a logical &quot;1&quot;. The simplest logic gate is an inverter ([NOT gate][2.1]), which takes one logical signal at its input and produces the opposite signal at its output (0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0). More complex gates take two or more input signals and produce specific outputs depending on the values of all input signals. Common examples are the [AND gate][2.2] (which outputs a logical 1 only when *all* of its inputs are 1) and the [OR gate][2.3] (which outputs a logical 1 if *any* of its inputs are 1).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a typical silicon chip, logic gates are built using [transistors][3.1], which are essentially tiny switches that use one electrical signal to turn another electrical signal on &amp; off. Modern transistors are [semiconductor devices][3.2]. In the early days of computing, electrical switching was done using [vacuum tubes][3.3]. Future CPU designs may use [light][3.4] or even [living cells][3.5].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whatever the technology used to make logic gates, the point is that many small gates can be combined together to perform complex mathematical calculations. In the digital world, numbers are represented in *binary*, or [base two][4.1]. We normally think of numbers in [base ten][4.2], which means that you have ten digits (&quot;zero&quot; through &quot;nine&quot;) which can be combined to form larger numbers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In base ten, the number 234 means:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    2x(10)^2 (two hundred) +&#xD;&#xA;    3x(10)^1 (thirty)      +&#xD;&#xA;    4x(10)^0 (four)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same number in base 2 would be `11101010` which means:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    1x(2)^7 +&#xD;&#xA;    1x(2)^6 +&#xD;&#xA;    1x(2)^5 +&#xD;&#xA;    0x(2)^4 +&#xD;&#xA;    1x(2)^3 +&#xD;&#xA;    0x(2)^2 +&#xD;&#xA;    1x(2)^1 +&#xD;&#xA;    0x(2)^0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Binary digits are usually called [bits][5.1]. Eight bits can be used to represent any number between 0 (`00000000`) and 255 (`11111111`). Eight bits are usually called a [byte][5.2], and most CPUs deal with numbers that are two, four, or eight bytes long (16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit [architecture][5.3]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Every CPU has its own &quot;language&quot; which we call [machine code][6.1]. This &quot;language&quot; uses binary numbers to represent [instructions][6.2] that can be performed by the CPU. Regardless of the specific [programming language][6.3] used, the end result is always machine code running on the CPU.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1.1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit&#xD;&#xA;  [1.2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_design&#xD;&#xA;  [1.3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate&#xD;&#xA;  [1.4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law&#xD;&#xA;  [1.5]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [2.1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOT_gate&#xD;&#xA;  [2.2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate&#xD;&#xA;  [2.3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OR_gate&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;  [3.1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor&#xD;&#xA;  [3.2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device&#xD;&#xA;  [3.3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube&#xD;&#xA;  [3.4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_computing&#xD;&#xA;  [3.5]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_computing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [4.1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system&#xD;&#xA;  [4.2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_%28mathematics%29&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [5.1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit&#xD;&#xA;  [5.2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte&#xD;&#xA;  [5.3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [6.1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code&#xD;&#xA;  [6.2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set&#xD;&#xA;  [6.3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Not many refineries in the US are capable of processing high sulfur crude oil, as more than half the refineries in the US have been shut down since 1976 due to mergers in the industry (oil companies have chosen to shut down and dismantle surplus refineries rather than allow someone to go into competition with them). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_distillation" />

Each of these subsystem is composed of many digital [logic gates][1.3]. A modern CPU can contain billions of logic gates.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Digital logic gates are electronic circuits that use an electrical voltage to define simple logical states. A low voltage (typically zero) is used to represent a logical &quot;0&quot;, while a higher voltage is used to represent a logical &quot;1&quot;. The simplest logic gate is an inverter ([NOT gate][2.1]), which takes one logical signal at its input and produces the opposite signal at its output (0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0). More complex gates take two or more input signals and produce specific outputs depending on the values of all input signals. Common examples are the [AND gate][2.2] (which outputs a logical 1 only when *all* of its inputs are 1) and the [OR gate][2.3] (which outputs a logical 1 if *any* of its inputs are 1).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a typical silicon chip, logic gates are built using [transistors][3.1], which are essentially tiny switches that use one electrical signal to turn another electrical signal on &amp; off. Modern transistors are [semiconductor devices][3.2]. In the early days of computing, electrical switching was done using [vacuum tubes][3.3]. Future CPU designs may use [light][3.4] or even [living cells][3.5].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whatever the technology used to make logic gates, the point is that many small gates can be combined together to perform complex mathematical calculations. In the digital world, numbers are represented in *binary*, or [base two][4.1]. We normally think of numbers in [base ten][4.2], which means that you have ten digits (&quot;zero&quot; through &quot;nine&quot;) which can be combined to form larger numbers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In base ten, the number 234 means:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    2x(10)^2 (two hundred) +&#xD;&#xA;    3x(10)^1 (thirty)      +&#xD;&#xA;    4x(10)^0 (four)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same number in base 2 would be `11101010` which means:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    1x(2)^7 +&#xD;&#xA;    1x(2)^6 +&#xD;&#xA;    1x(2)^5 +&#xD;&#xA;    0x(2)^4 +&#xD;&#xA;    1x(2)^3 +&#xD;&#xA;    0x(2)^2 +&#xD;&#xA;    1x(2)^1 +&#xD;&#xA;    0x(2)^0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Binary digits are usually called [bits][5.1]. Eight bits can be used to represent any number between 0 (`00000000`) and 255 (`11111111`). Eight bits are usually called a [byte][5.2], and most CPUs deal with numbers that are two, four, or eight bytes long (16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit [architecture][5.3]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Every CPU has its own &quot;language&quot; which we call [machine code][6.1].

Now, your center of gravity is not above the wheels, you start to tip toward the left, and begin to turn to the left to keep yourself upright. Conversely, when you stop turning, you turn a little bit harder, which brings your center of gravity back over the wheels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On bicycles, this mechanism can be very slight so you might not realize it unless you are trying to turn very fast at very high speeds.

So to reduce the costs of copper, and increase the amount of exports (and so jobs in mining) the government can lower interest rates - so all the people who had their money in Canadian banks will now sell those Canadian dollars and change them into an other country who has the new highest interest rates.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Preheated oil is introduced into a column with a variable number of plates, each of them punched with holes capped with a mushroom-shaped cap.

Each plate also has a reflux where the liquid part can flow at a lower plate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Distillation column][1]&#xD;&#xA;[image credits][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The established gradient of temperatures and the balance of mass (liquids, vapor which become liquid, liquid that becomes vapor, and vapor) can be calculated and is critical for the characteristics of the separations, which reaches an equilibrium and produces light components on top column (e.g. LPG), petrol, kerosene, diesel, fuel oil, and asphalts on the bottom column. Each of these extractions are not a pure compound. They are a mixture of compounds with the same boiling point, according to a series or rules for gas/liquid separation of mixtures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once this separation is performed, the amount of petrol for cars is relatively low. Since a big part of the market for oil is in petrol, additional processes are performed to increase this yield. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Cracking][3] (thermal or catalytic) is used to break down the high-boiling, high-molecular weight fraction into smaller chunks, either via temperature, or with a catalizer. In some cases, hydrogen is added to regulate the final products ([hydrocracking][4]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Reforming][5] is instead used to improve the octane number (an important characteristic to precisely regulate ignition in the engine). Reforming is performed via a catalytic process, normally using catalizers nets of platinum or rhenium. These catalizers are highly sensitive to sulphur, so it must be removed before entering the column, or a full deactivation (poisoning) can occur.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The process yields a wide variety of byproducts, such as methane (which is sold as such), sulphur (used to produce SO3 and Sulphuric acid), ammonia (normally bottled or used in-situ to produce fertilizers) and many other additional compounds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.imgur.com/A7E85.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tray_Distillation_Tower.PNG&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_%28chemistry%29&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocracking#Hydrocracking&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalytic_reforming" />

Bear with me if it takes a bit to get to the part of the answer that you're looking for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first technique is to use something called relative dating. This is a basic geologic tool that allows geologists to sort things by, essentially, how far down the geologic strata they are. Simply put, if you can look into the rock record and tell which end is up, you can say that the stuff put down more recently contains fossils that are younger than the stuff put down a long time ago. This is how geologists date fossils in the field, without the assistance of laboratory analysis, and is why we continue to use terms like the &quot;Cretaceous&quot; for identification, rather than just specifying the age of the fossil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second technique is called radiometric dating. This uses the radioactive decay of an element over time to determine the age of the object in question. This involves measuring the abundance of the parent (the isotope of the element that is decaying) and the daughter (the isotope of the element that it decays into) isotopes relative to some known standard, typically a non-radiogenic isotope (an isotope that is neither radioactive, nor a product of the decay of a different isotope) of the parent element, and then modeling the age of the object based on some known parameters - for example the initial abundance of the parent element in the object.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For things as young as many fossils, 14C decay is most frequently used because it has a half-life of about 5730 years (after about 5 half-lives the element is too scarce to accurately date the sample). 14C is a bit peculiar since the parent is continuously generated by the interaction of the Earth's atmosphere with solar radiation. This gives us some constraints on the abundance of 14C in an organism when it dies. For older fossils, other systems are used.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The accuracy of several key variables changes the maximum precision on an age date. These variables include the half life (the time it takes for half of a parent isotope to decay away - often reported as a &quot;decay constant&quot; which has a mathematical relationship to the half-life), the initial abundance of the parent isotope, the initial abundance of the daughter isotope, and the degree of alteration the sample has experienced." />

So at these times the flaps are extended, effectively changing the shape of the wing to give more lift (by &quot;cupping&quot; the air more underneath the wing).  This has the negative effect of increasing the drag, so it takes more energy to push the airplane through the air with this less-streamlined wing form, but this lower efficiency is not as important for the short time the extra lift is needed.  (You may notice that in the very last phase of landing, the pilot increases the power to the engines, even though you are still descending; this is to counteract the increased drag from the extended flaps.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For more detail, see [Wikipedia's flap article][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_%28physics%29&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_%28force%29&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_%28aircraft%29" />

The means that at different altitudes, a different shape of bell is optimal. At sea level, ambient air pressure is at its highest, and so the bell can be very short and have a very wide angle, whereas in orbit, ambient pressure is almost nothing and so the optimum nozzle would be very long and have a very small flare angle. (look how long the nozzles on [shuttle and its booster rockets][1], the shuttle nozzles are much longer because they are designed for higher altitudes)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An aerospike however is what is called an _altitude compensating nozzle_. How it works is that that the air pressure around the jet influences how much it can expand and therefore effectively changes the size of the nozzle as the rocket gains height. Through recirculation below the wedge of the spike, the two jets heat the air, increasing the pressure in a place that would other have an vacuum (by [Bernoulli's law][2]), the net effect of which is an area of roughly atmospheric pressure, which balances the normal air pressure on top of the rocket, meaning there is no _disadvantage_ to having the spike at sea level. At high altitude this higher pressure actually increases the thrust to the rocket, and the decreased air pressure surrounding the jet, has the same effect of a larger nozzle, also contributing to the compensating effect. To cut a long story short, it has the same effect as a normal bell nozzle which changes its shape so suit the altitude (a _good_ thing).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The debate about the efficiency rises from two things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Above the speed of sound (which rockets sometimes are), the pressure around the jet rapidly decreases due to the supersonic flow and so there is a drop in efficiency there.&#xD;&#xA; 2. The surface which the jet hugs (the spike), has to be cooled (to stop it melting), and the surface area is much larger than in a normal bell nozzle. So some argue that the gains from the aerospike design are wiped out straight away by the energy required to stop it melting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.hightechscience.org/Buran_Space_Shuttle_Comparsion_1.gif&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle" />

Fortunately we can measure how fast something is moving from the Doppler shift of the spectral lines in it's light. We simply measure the wavelength of say Hydrogen line in a distant galaxy, work out how different that is from stationary Hydrogen in the lab and we have the speed - multiply by Hubble's constant and we have the distance. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At very large distances there is a tricky bit about deciding what shape the universe is, since we can measure light emmitted when the universe was only 0.5M yr old and much smaller.

Nearly all systems use the DOCSIS standard for cable internet(Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) Each regular channel(not compressed through digital MPEG encoders) only take up around 6MhZ each. This can further be reduced with a digital box that decodes M-PEG streams to fit more into a 6MhZ slice. In cable the 5-65MhZ is set for upstream data, and 850-1000MhZ is for down stream. Notice that like DSL this is asymmetric in that your Download and upload aren't the same. The biggest reason for this is that it is assumed that consumers will download more than they upload.(and usually right too.) A cable modem is similar to a DSL transceiver in that it will choose a block to communicate on that is clear of other traffic in the ranges I listed above. Now each of these &quot;channels&quot; allows ~30Mbits of data. I'll explain how you get more in the next section &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How does the speed increase with upgrades? Well the DOCSIS standard allows Channel bonding, where your modem can use multiple channels to send and receive more data. DOCSIS 3.0, the newest standard allows a unlimited amount of channels to be used, meaning that is up to the ISP to have the equipment to support all these channels, and the backhaul that is required. This is where cable &quot;slowdowns&quot; occur if the ISP doesn't keep the backhaul , the node equipment up to date or oversubscribes, or even a combination of the three, then the node can't support all the users and your internet slows as a result.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Here][1] is a link for the DOCSIS standard, and [this][2] one is for cable internet in general.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOCSIS&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_Internet_access" />

If Zone 1 needs to be cooled but zone 2 doesn't the thermostat will close the VCD to restrict the flow of air.

On incredibly large buildings these can be computer controlled for precise cooling/heating anywhere in the building. It is also *possible* that you have 2 air handlers installed, but this is highly unlikely as they would take a large amount of power to run and maintain. On building that a decent size VCDs and multiple air handlers are used but that is unlikely for your house for the reasons listed above.

It is a balancing act between the competing hormones that suppress growth and stimulate growth. The chilling will slow down the production of growth suppressing hormones until eventually the levels of growth stimulating hormones overwhelm them and buds appear. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Changes in the amount of light/darkness also change some hormone levels in plants. This is called [photoperiodism][1], and there are lots of examples of each type.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Temperate zone fruit trees have a chilling requirement, where the tree must spend X hours below Y temperature in order to successfully produce the buds that produce fruit in the following growing season. [This link][2] has a table showing peach trees and the minimum number of hours they require below 45°F. This constrains where a tree may be grown to produce fruit. The northernmost counties of Florida are lucky to get 400 hours below 45°F each year, so most years a peach tree (a low chill variety) in Orlando would not produce flowers (and thus no peaches). Climate change will drastically change where crops can be grown because of the collision of chilling requirements with day/night time cycles (which control which latitudes plants can grow in). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Up here at these higher altitudes, many of the trees were bare and have only recently started growing leaves, weeks later than at lower elevations.* &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The drop in air pressure as you increase in altitude also drops air temperature. It is about 9°F per half mile of altitude gain (or if you'd prefer, [6.2°C per km of altitude][3]). This is equivalent to being about 200 miles north per half mile of altitude. I once had a job &quot;in the mountains&quot; and the daily commute involved a 4000 foot elevation change (the lower elevation is the city of Denver, itself officially at 5280 feet above sea level). The daily temperature swings were pretty extreme (shorts in the city, winter coat at the office) most days, and the last snow of the year at the office was usually in May (it was a warm year if it didn't snow before Labor Day). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoperiodism&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/hil/hil-327.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.ciese.org/curriculum/weatherproj2/en/lessonC3.shtml" />

For that reason, having the modem connected to the master socket by as short a run of cable as possible - then running longer ethernet cables to your destination - is a vastly preferable practice. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With regards to how DSL achieves such greater bandwidth, it's a combination of highly efficient error correction and encoding combined with the greater raw bandwidth utilised by the technology over standard analogue V.92 modems. ADSL employs both Reed-Solomon and Trellis Coded Modulation for different ranges of data to accommodate for line noise, interference and LOS. In the UK and some overseas countries, ADSL data is commonly transmitted inside [ATM cells](http://www.kitz.co.uk/adsl/data_transmission.htm) as PPP frames - the protocol known as PPPoA (RFC 2364). PPPoA is also advantageous as the customer's router can be required to authenticate to the ISP's [BRAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband_Remote_Access_Server) with a valid username and password prior to obtaining Internet access. The other advantage of using PPPoA encapsulation is that it provisions for Header Error Checking and Forward Error Checking (part of the interleaving technology) which further stabilises throughput on problematic lines. The other main protocol of data transmission is PPPoE, but explanation of this technology is beyond the scope of this answer. PPPoE is not commonly used in the UK due in part to historical reasons and also due to complexities arising from mixing the two standards on a national network. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Interleaving](http://www.kitz.co.uk/adsl/interleaving.htm) is usually applied by default to the data (which increases its resilience to interference, but raises the latency slightly). Clueful ISPs, at least in the UK, will disable interleaving upon request - putting the line into &quot;fastpath&quot; modem - which increases its susceptibility to LOS from interference but can almost halve the RTT, making a connection far better suited for VoIP or online gaming where low latency is very important.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further reading: [Kitz.co.uk's ADSL FAQ pages][3] for a lot of detailed information about many aspects of DSL, [this][1] Wikipedia article for more on the DSL specification and [this][2] for more on DSLAM equipment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Subscriber_Line&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Subscriber_Line_Access_Multiplexer&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.kitz.co.uk/adsl/equip.htm" />

When a cell divides, each new cell gets DNA built from one half of double DNA spiral, so if it is damaged, the cell has high probability of being broken and die. Since cancer cells divide more quickly, they have more probability of accumulating errors and thus die. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, cancer cells usually the result of several mutations of a properly functioning cell, which frequently means that they have some DNA repair mechanisms disabled or not functioning correctly (otherwise it would repair the errors that made the cell cancerous) - which in turn means that cancerous cells frequently have less defenses against further damage that normal cells.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;Still, such therapy is dangerous - so usually it is focused on specific areas and also uses methods like concentrating multiple beams (so that other tissues get only part of the damage while the tumor gets the whole power of all beams). But still the danger of introducing secondary cancer due to irradiating healthy cells and breaking them is there.  " />

You can see that the peaks are somewhat haphazard, but the valleys are flat and precise.  Inside the lock, there are a series of (usually 4-7) stacks tiny metal cylinders which travel vertically.  These are called pins.  The pins fit into the valleys in your key.  Each pin is very roughly the diameter of a grain of rice, with a length of 2-8mm or so.  The pins are on springs so that they are normally pushed down, but when the key is inserted, the pins are raised up.  When they are all raised to the precisely correct level, the lock is allowed to turn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a normal lock, each stack of pins has two pins.  The one that touches the key is called the key pin.  When the tiny gap between the pins is raised to the &quot;shear line&quot; of the lock, that stack does not prevent the lock from turning.  When every stack is raised to the correct level, the lock can be opened.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**MASTER KEYED LOCKS**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a master key system, the stacks have more than two pins.  As such, more than one valley height is acceptable for each position along the key.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you had the following set of 4-pin locks (I am using [x,y] to mean a pin stack that can be opened by a key cut to either x or y at that location):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    [1,2] [1,5] [1,8] [1,4]&#xD;&#xA;    [1,3] [1,3] [1,3] [1,3]&#xD;&#xA;    [1,6] [1,6] [1,6] [1,6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can see that the 1111 key opens all four locks, and the keys 2584, 3333, and 6666 are the &quot;change keys&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**That's it** - what follows is merely hobby. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A 9 represents the deepest cut, and a 0 or 1 is the shallowest cut.  The master key is usually set up to use lower numbers; this prevents a user from filing down his change key into a master key.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(It is interesting to note that there are actually 16 keys that open each of these locks...)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are other systems you can use too.  For example if we modify the first stack of the above three locks&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    [1,2] [1,5] [1,8] [1,4]&#xD;&#xA;    [1,2] [1,3] [1,3] [1,3]&#xD;&#xA;    [1,2] [1,6] [1,6] [1,6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We can see that 2111 is still a master key for these locks.  This allows multiple levels of security.  For example these three locks could be server closets, and you could give the building sysadmin the 2111 key.  However, you could give the head of facilities the 1111 key which would open every door in the building.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is great because it allows you to have cascaded security systems without needing more than 2 levels in any stack.  The more levels, the more expensive the lock is to produce and maintain, and the easier it is to pick (imagine if every level was a valid level...)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also cheaper to build is a system like this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    [1] [1] [1] [1,4]&#xD;&#xA;    [1] [1] [1] [1,3]&#xD;&#xA;    [1] [1] [1] [1,6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have every worked/lived in a master-keyed system, you may find that the first section of your key (near the hilt) is the same as your coworkers/dorm-mates." />

Text="Different trees have different mechanisms. Mostly it is temperature, but light cycle variations can also make trees think that it is the wrong time of year. Some years ago, I lived in an apartment building where one side of a tree in the courtyard had a spotlight shining on part of the tree (basically, it was shining on the sign but the tree had grown to obstruct part of the light). The part of the tree within the spotlight beam had leaves attempting to grow when the rest of the tree was dormant, and for the coldest part of the year, the tree would try to put out leaves.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Temperature levels change hormones in plants. It is a balancing act between the competing hormones that suppress growth and stimulate growth. The chilling will slow down the production of growth suppressing hormones until eventually the levels of growth stimulating hormones overwhelm them and buds appear. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Changes in the amount of light/darkness also change some hormone levels in plants. This is called [photoperiodism][1], and there are lots of examples of each type. In photoperiodism, certain parts of the photo receptors of the plant (the [Phytochromes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochrome) called [Chromophores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromophore) are affected by light, and as the Chromophores absorb light, they cause the proteins they are part of to change. [According to Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochrome#Biochemistry), it is believed these changes trigger specific effects in the genes of the plant, causing the plant to change it's behavior:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Chemically, phytochrome consists of a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; chromophore, a single bilin molecule&#xD;&#xA;&gt; consisting of an open chain of four&#xD;&#xA;&gt; pyrrole rings, bonded to the protein&#xD;&#xA;&gt; moiety. It is the chromophore that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; absorbs light, and as a result changes&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the conformation of bilin and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; subsequently that of the attached&#xD;&#xA;&gt; protein, changing it from one state or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; isoform to the other [...] The Pfr&#xD;&#xA;&gt; state passes on a signal to other&#xD;&#xA;&gt; biological systems in the cell, such&#xD;&#xA;&gt; as the mechanisms responsible for gene&#xD;&#xA;&gt; expression. Although this mechanism is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; almost certainly a biochemical&#xD;&#xA;&gt; process, it is still the subject of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; much debate &lt;sup&gt;[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochrome#Biochemistry)&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Temperate zone fruit trees have a chilling requirement, where the tree must spend X hours below Y temperature in order to successfully produce the buds that produce fruit in the following growing season. [This link][2] has a table showing peach trees and the minimum number of hours they require below 45°F. This constrains where a tree may be grown to produce fruit. The northernmost counties of Florida are lucky to get 400 hours below 45°F each year, so most years a peach tree (a low chill variety) in Orlando would not produce flowers (and thus no peaches). Climate change will drastically change where crops can be grown because of the collision of chilling requirements with day/night time cycles (which control which latitudes plants can grow in). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Up here at these higher altitudes, many of the trees were bare and have only recently started growing leaves, weeks later than at lower elevations.* &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The drop in air pressure as you increase in altitude also drops air temperature. It is about 9°F per half mile of altitude gain (or if you'd prefer, [6.2°C per km of altitude][3]). This is equivalent to being about 200 miles north per half mile of altitude. I once had a job &quot;in the mountains&quot; and the daily commute involved a 4000 foot elevation change (the lower elevation is the city of Denver, itself officially at 5280 feet above sea level). The daily temperature swings were pretty extreme (shorts in the city, winter coat at the office) most days, and the last snow of the year at the office was usually in May (it was a warm year if it didn't snow before Labor Day). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoperiodism&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/hil/hil-327.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.ciese.org/curriculum/weatherproj2/en/lessonC3.shtml" />

You can see that the peaks are somewhat haphazard, but the valleys are flat and precise.  Inside the lock, there are a series of (usually 4-7) stacks tiny metal cylinders which travel vertically.  These are called pins.  The pins fit into the valleys in your key.  Each pin is very roughly the diameter of a grain of rice, with a length of 2-8mm or so.  The pins are on springs so that they are normally pushed down, but when the key is inserted, the pins are raised up.  When they are all raised to the precisely correct level, the lock is allowed to turn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a normal lock, each stack of pins has two pins.  The one that touches the key is called the key pin.  When the tiny gap between the pins is raised to the &quot;shear line&quot; of the lock, that stack does not prevent the lock from turning.  When every stack is raised to the correct level, the lock can be opened.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**MASTER KEYED LOCKS**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a master key system, the stacks have more than two pins.  As such, more than one valley height is acceptable for each position along the key.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you had the following set of 4-pin locks (I am using [x,y] to mean a pin stack that can be opened by a key cut to either x or y at that location):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    [1,2] [1,5] [1,8] [1,4]&#xD;&#xA;    [1,3] [1,3] [1,3] [1,3]&#xD;&#xA;    [1,6] [1,6] [1,6] [1,6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can see that the 1111 key opens all three locks, and the keys 2584, 3333, and 6666 are the &quot;change keys&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**That's it** - what follows is merely hobby. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A 9 represents the deepest cut, and a 0 or 1 is the shallowest cut.  The master key is usually set up to use lower numbers; this prevents a user from filing down his change key into a master key.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(It is interesting to note that there are actually 16 keys that open each of these locks...)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are other systems you can use too.  For example if we modify the first stack of the above three locks&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    [1,2] [1,5] [1,8] [1,4]&#xD;&#xA;    [1,2] [1,3] [1,3] [1,3]&#xD;&#xA;    [1,2] [1,6] [1,6] [1,6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We can see that 2111 is still a master key for these locks.  This allows multiple levels of security.  For example these three locks could be server closets, and you could give the building sysadmin the 2111 key.  However, you could give the head of facilities the 1111 key which would open every door in the building.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is great because it allows you to have cascaded security systems without needing more than 2 levels in any stack.

Then your image is facing south. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But both your head and your image's head are at the top of your body, and your feet and your image's feet are at the bottom of your body, and your left hand and the corresponding hand of your image are both pointing west, while your right hand and the corresponding hand of your image are both pointing east.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only &quot;flip&quot; is front-to-back.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With respect to the physics aspect of this, see [Wikipedia][1] or other physics textbooks; mirrors have a smooth flat metal conductive coating. In an electrical conductor, the electromagnetic field within the metal is nulled out, and this causes electromagnetic waves to reflect off the surface of the metal much like a billiard ball bounces off the edge of a pool table. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28physics%29" />

They can actually bin images in such a way that the charge is passed from one row to the next in the same amount of time it takes to move over the pixel's resolution at the orbiting planet. Thus a single pixel can be integrated twice, without loosing as much signal. In effect, it drastically improves the signal to noise ratio.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;CMOS cameras typically have each pixel read in it's own information, thus reducing the amount of artifacts, but also reducing the amount of light a given pixel can receive." />

They are produced by injecting diluted venom into an animal such as a sheep, and then harvesting and purifying the antibodies the animal produces to fight the venom.

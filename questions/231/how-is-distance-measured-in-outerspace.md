For instance, how do we determine that Earth is 1.503Ã—10^8 km from the Sun?

<p>Spacecraft and radar are only useful for measuring distance in our solar system - so we have very accurate distances to the moon, venus, mars and mercury.</p>

<p>For nearby stars we use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec" rel="nofollow">parallax</a>. We measure the apparent movement of a nearby star against the background of distant stars as the earth moves around the sun.<br>
Hold your finger out and close your left and right eye alternately - the finger seems to move against the background - if you measure this angle and know the distance between your eyes you can work out the length of your arm.      </p>

<p>This only works from the ground for the nearest few dozen stars - a very accurate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparcos" rel="nofollow">satelite</a> above the atmosphere's blurring effect measured the nearest few 10,000s stars.</p>

<p>For more distant objects we use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_modulus" rel="nofollow">magnitude distance</a> relationship. Stars further away look fainter because the light has spread out more before it gets to us. Since the light is spreading out into a sphere as we get 2x as far away the light appears 1/4 as bright. If we know how bright the star actually is (it's absolute magnitude) and measure how bright it appears (apparent magnitude) we can easily work out how far away it is.</p>

<p>We estimate how bright it <em>really</em> is from it's temperature (from it's colour) and chemical signature but our best distance measuring tool at long distance are something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid" rel="nofollow">Cepheid variables</a>. These stars vary in brightness over a few days, which is easy to measure, but importantly the time they take to change depends on their size which tells us their absolute magnitude.  So we simply measure their brightness as we see them, and how long it takes to vary - that tells us how bright they really are and we get the distance. As an extra bonus cepheids are very bright so we can see them in nearby galaxies</p>

<p>For the ultimate most distant objects we use the expansion of the universe. As the universe is expanding - everything appears to be moving away from us (important note - there is nothing special about where we are, if the whole universe is expanding then everything appears to move away from everything else). From this if we can measure how fast something is moving away form us we can find it's distance (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law" rel="nofollow">Hubble's law</a>). Fortunately we can measure how fast something is moving from the Doppler shift of the spectral lines in it's light. We simply measure the wavelength of say Hydrogen line in a distant galaxy, work out how different that is from stationary Hydrogen in the lab and we have the speed - multiply by Hubble's constant and we have the distance. </p>

<p>At very large distances there is a tricky bit about deciding what shape the universe is, since we can measure light emmitted when the universe was only 0.5M yr old and much smaller. It becomes a bit philosophical about what you mean by distance - so we just talk in terms of redshift</p>

Well.. there are many methods in doing that.

the older methods

- triangulation ( http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=400 )
- parallax ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec )
- solar and lunar eclipse  ( http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/lectures/gkastr1.html )

of course now that we have space ships...

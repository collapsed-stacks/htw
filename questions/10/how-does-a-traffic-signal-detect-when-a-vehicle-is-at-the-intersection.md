How does a traditional traffic signal, with a wire in the pavement at the stop line, detect when a vehicle is sitting at the stop line?

*By stop line, I mean the thick white line that marks where you should stop without going into the intersection (in the US)*

Underneath the pavement (often a narrow channel is carved out rather than actually digging out the entire surface) and a conductive loop is lain out.  

When a sufficiently large body of metal moves over it, it induces a current which the sensor decides is a car. 

This means a person should not be able to trigger such a thing.

A bicycle does not have sufficient metal, usually, to trigger these (Especially if you were riding a carbon fibre bike) though I am told that in high bicycle riding areas (Denver for some odd reason is the example I have heard) they can tune the sensitivity such that most bikes will trigger the sensor.

There are several different ways to detect that a car is stopping at the stop line of a traffic signal.

The most common one is a sensor that is put underneath the pavement which works by detecting the changes of the magnetic field it emits. A car has a lot of metal and hence influences this magnetic field when it stands on top of this sensor.

Some traffic lights also use motion detectors similar to sensors that are used in burglary alarm systems in houses.

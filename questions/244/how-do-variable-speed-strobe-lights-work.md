If I am right, a strobe light works by rapidly charging a capacitor and once it reaches a certain level it will discharge causing the light to flash.  How then does a variable speed strobe light work?

What is typically done with this type of scenario is you have some resister that connects to the capacitor. If one varies the intensity of this resister, the capacitor will take longer to charge up, thus varying the frequency.

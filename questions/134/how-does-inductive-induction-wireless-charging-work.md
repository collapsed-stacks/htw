What are the principles behind inductive/wireless charging? What is the efficiency of this method of power transfer?

I have seen diagrams of coils for the electronic toothbrushes with inductive charging systems. Is a having a coil surrounded by another more efficient than inductive charging with flat pads?

<p>The basic principle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_coupling" rel="nofollow">electromagnetic induction</a> is that an electric current flowing in a wire will produce a magnetic field around that wire, and (most importantly) vice-versa (a magnetic field around a wire will produce a corresponding electric current in that wire). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_coupling" rel="nofollow">Inductive coupling</a> occurs when two wires are placed close to each-other, so that a current flowing in one wire will <em>induce</em> a current in the second wire by way of the magnetic field. This is the exact same principle used in power transformers. The efficiency of the transfer (i.e. the amount of current produced in the "target" wire versus the amount of current sent through the "source" wire) is dependent on:</p>

<ol>
<li>how close the two wires are together (the closer the better)</li>
<li>how long the wires are (the longer the better)</li>
<li>the geometry of the wires (coils tend to work better)</li>
<li>the resonant frequency of each coil (matched coils are better)</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging" rel="nofollow">Inductive charging</a> makes use of inductive coupling to produce current in a coil of wire inside the battery-powered device by creating a charging current in a coil of wire near that device.</p>

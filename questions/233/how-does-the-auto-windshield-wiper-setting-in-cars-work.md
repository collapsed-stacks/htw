I have seen an auto setting for the intermittent windshield wiper speed in the newer BMW 335 as well as other cars. It speeds up and slows down depending on what seems like the amount of water that is on the windshield.

What sort of detection is being used to adjust the speed?

<p>The sensor uses an optical effect called total internal reflection. If you shine a beam of light (in this case invisible infrared light) into a piece of glass at the correct angle it bounces back from the outer surface as if it was a mirror. If you put another transparent material in contact with the glass (eg water) the optical arrangement is different and the light is no longer reflected. A detector in the sensor notices this and starts the wipers</p>

<p>The sensor is behind the mirror because it has to be in contact with glass.</p>

In my experience with them there is usually a small sensor behind the rear-view mirror.  It detects a vibration similar to what it knows as rain, and adjusts the speed of the wipers accordingly.

How do the screens of ebook reader (using e-ink) work? They don't seem to emit any light and can be read where there are lots of light while lcds can't?

it is some sort of package, in which each pixel is something illustrated below:
inside the big capsule there are multiple charged, colored (some black and some white, of different charge, white ones not shown in picture) microspheres where the two would be attracted to different side depending on potential difference applied across the upper and the lower electrode.

in the illustrated case the black colored microsphere face upwards, thus the pixel is black.

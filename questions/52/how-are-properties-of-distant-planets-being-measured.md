I always wondered how it's possible to measure properties of stars/planets that are really far away.

Take [this pulsar][1] as an example. It is roughly 2283 lightyears away, but the Wikipedia page lists rotation, mass, age etc.

I guess the rotation-speed is rather easy to measure for a pulsar, but what about other planets/stars? How can age and mass be measured?

<p>We can work out things like the rough amounts of elements present on distant planets by looking at the spectrum of light they reflect. Every element in the universe has particular frequencies of light that they absorb and reflect and so by looking at what frequencies are being absorbed (not given off) and reflected we can work out what elements are there.</p>

<p>We can also work out their distance from us by looking at their light too.</p>

<p>Once we know how far away something is and in what direction, we can look at how it interacts with other objects around it, like how things orbit it and so on. Using this information we can predict its mass and rotation speed.</p>

<p>Age is the really tricky one. We can work out how old the light is that reaches us by using how far away a planet is (which gives us an estimate of a minimum age), but beyond that it is very difficult to accurately know the age of a planet. A star however is slightly easier because stars go through a lifecycle - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star#Formation_and_evolution" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star#Formation_and_evolution</a> - , and we can work out how old a star might be by what stage in its life it is in (which we can work out via the colour of the light).</p>

<p>Kepler (the current planet finder satellite in orbit) has a wide focus staring camera that is astonishingly sensitive).  It looks at a large portion of the sky waiting for the light of a star to dim, since a planet is typically big enough to cause the light reaching Earth to dim at least a little bit as it transits the far away sun on each orbit.</p>

<p>Thus the longer you look (since an orbit of a year, would take at least 2-3 years to confirm on 2-3 transits) the more you can find.  Initially most of the found planets were in crazy tight orbits of a few days.  But with Kepler more are being found (1200+ last I checked) with longer orbits (into the month range now).  </p>

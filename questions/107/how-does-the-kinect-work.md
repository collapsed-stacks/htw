How does the Kinect work?

1. The Kinect uses cameras to detect not only images, but also the "depth" of each part of the image. What is the mechanism by which this works?

2. Once the image and depth-map are obtained, how is it then able to detect the players' (skeletal recognition) movements? Describe, preferably in layman's terms, the algorithms and other technology involved in this translation.

Thanks!!

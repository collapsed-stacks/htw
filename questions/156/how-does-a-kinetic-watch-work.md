Some of us may already be wearing a kinetic watch on their daily activities. How does it work? How long can it go on without movement...

<p>A rather large (in terms of wristwatch sizes) rotor is set in motion whenever you move the watch. The movement is then used to wind up the spring mechanism of the watch. There are different approaches to translate the rotor-movement into a rotation that can be used to wind up the spring. A quite simple and elegant construction is called "Pellaton Winding" and was invented by Albert Pellaton (former technical director at <a href="http://www.iwc.com/" rel="nofollow">IWC</a>).</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMh3MpnOVPs" rel="nofollow">video</a> shows the winding in action, and here's a <a href="http://www.p178host.com/iwcgallery/Ingenieur2005/iwc_pellaton.jpg" rel="nofollow">diagram</a> of it.</p>

<p>The amount of time your watch can go without movement is highly dependent of the quality of the watch. High quality watches will run from 6-7 days without being moved.</p>

Self-winding watches work by using small weights (which move during normal wrist movements) to wind up the spring mechanism. 

Usually, they can go about 2-3 days without winding.

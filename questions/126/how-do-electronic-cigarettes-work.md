The question is in the title. More specifically how does the vaporizer work, and what is the substance they are vaporizing?

The vaporizer is really just a heating element, which heats up the liquid in the container and turns into a gaseous state. Normally, all that is in it is propylene glycol(additive recognized safe by the US FDA), Nicotine,and any favoring or additives that come with flavoring.

I know small radio waves (microwaves) are generated by the oven and those somehow heat the food.  How are those microwaves created?  How do the microwaves actually cause the food to heat up?

The oven produces electromagnetic radiation which is absorbed by the food in a process called dielectric heating.

The polar molecules within the food will align themselves in an electric field.  If this field oscillates, which happens in electromagnetic waves, the molecules will continuously rotate to try an align themselves with the field.  As they rotate, the molecules will bump into each other, distributing that kinetic energy as heat energy. The temperature is therefore the average of kinetic energy of the atoms in the food.

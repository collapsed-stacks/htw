How exactly does a permanent magnet work, and what makes some kinds of magnets stronger?

Is it possible to make an existing permanent magnet stronger and if so, how?

All magnetism works by some kind of moving charge. In the case of a permanent magnet, what is moving is the electrons around an atom. Iron, among a few other materials, has the capability to have a substantial portion of it's electrons move in the same direction, if they are somehow forced to start doing that.

If a magnetic material is exposed to a strong magnetic force for a period of time, then the magnetism can stick, causing the material to become magnetic permanently. So, if you want to take an existing magnet and make it stronger, then you need to expose it to an even stronger magnetic force first, and it will retain a significant amount of it's force.

There are a few key attributes that cause a material to be magnetic, and to really understand it, you have to know a fair bit about chemistry. Electrons orbit around a nucleus of an atom, in specific shells. The names of these shells are s, p, d, and f. (Don't ask...) For the s shell, there is 1 orbit, p= 3, d=5, and f=7. For each orbit, there can be 2 electrons in the orbit, going in opposite directions.

The most magnetic materials have all of their electrons going in one direction in the outermost shell, with none of them going in the other direction. That is why iron is such a highly magnetic material, it has 5 electrons in it's outermost d orbital. 

I should add that there are other rules to what makes a material magnetic, but they're rather advanced, so...

Fundamentally magnetism is caused by moving charges or [Spin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_%28physics%29) (which you can basically imagine as a rotation of a particle around its own axis, but this is _really_ oversimplified!). Elementary magnetism is caused by the latter, and the macroscopic magnetism is then caused by the forming of large [Magnetic domains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism#Magnetic_domains).

To make a permanent magnet stronger you can attach another magnet in such way that they attract each other, or imply attach any [ferromagnetic material](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism) (e.g. iron).

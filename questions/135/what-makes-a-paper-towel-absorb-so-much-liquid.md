How is it that paper towels hold so much liquid where similar materials do not?

Paper towels consist of multitude of long fibers with lots of long narrow spaces between the fibers. That's why a paper towel feels so soft and light, compared to regular paper.

Volume of the space between fibers of a paper towel is rather large: compare the thickness of a paper towel and a sheet of office paper of equal weight. Actually a sheet of office paper would weigh as much as 2-4 sheets of paper towel. They consist of about the same amount of cellulose fibers, but fibers in towels are far looser, giving ample space to draw water in.

The spaces between fibers act as long pipes into which water is drawn by [capillary force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_force). In short, the fibers attract water on contact: the fibers get wet. Molecules of water also weakly attract each other, so larger amounts of water gets drawn to the point of contact between water and the fibers, and new portions of fiber get wet. The process continues until all the fibers are wet or all the nearby water is drawn in.

Sponges act similarly, but use different material to form the same long narrow interconnected cavities for water.

<p>Also individual fibers in paper towels themselves will absorb water because of their chemical composition. Paper is made of cellulose (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization" rel="nofollow">polymerized</a> sugar molecules) which has hydrogen bonds with hydrogen atoms sticking out of it positively charged. Now the negative ends of the water molecules are attracted to them, which draws water (water is a polar molecule with positive charge at one end and negative at the other end). </p>

Short answer: it absorbs so much liquid because it has so much surface area.

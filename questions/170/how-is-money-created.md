I'm not asking about the actual bank note but the value associated with it.

Who decide to create more money? Is it possible to destroy money? When and for which reason is new money emitted?

Currency that started out in ancient times was made up of the actual precious metal that they were called (i.e.- silver was actually silver and gold was actually gold).  Since these metals were desired by many people they became the standard for which to exchange goods and services.  Without a common desire for a particular type of currency, it has very little value.

After societies advanced and the amount of currency that was needed to move around became prohibitive (metals can be very heavy and cumbersome to transport), governments began creating a currency that was based on the precious metals they stored.  So if you had a British pound a long time ago that meant you had a claim on a certain amount of the precious metals that the mint stored.  The currencies that used this system were often referred to as being on the `Gold Standard`.  I believe almost all countries' currencies start out this way, including the United States.

Through history, for various reasons from political gain to economic policy, many countries have moved off the `Gold Standard` to a system based on faith in the goverment.  For instance, all US currency is based on the user's faith in the United States government to back the dollar.  If the government were to collapse tomorrow, all the dollars you might have would become worthless, there is no gold/silver/etc sitting in a vault that you could claim.

What determines the comparative "value" of a currency against others?  

Are they geographically independent? I mean: a US dollar has the same "exchange value" everywhere?  

If the exchange values are NOT geographically independent, it seems at first sight that you may make money just moving it from country to country. Is that possible?

Typically most currencies are affected by the forces of supply and demand. As the demand for a currency goes up the value goes up. If the supply goes up the value goes up. The demand might be triggered by buyers realizing that the economy of that country is getting stronger. Supply can be controlled by the country printing money creating a larger supply of the currency. 

The FOREX is a decentralized market in which currency trading is happening 24 hours a day. The top three centers of activity are the UK, the US and Japan. It is by far the largest market by volume. 

In theory you could make money by trading currency and some people try to do this. However once many people discover the trade patterns which make money the demand for the currencies changes the prices and making money would no longer be possible.

The strength of a currency is also determined by the exports of that country and it's interest rates.

If I need to buy copper from Canada I have to pay in Canadian dollars. So if lots of people want copper and Canada is the best/cheapest/only place to get it then everybody wants to buy Canadian dollars and those people who have them (including the Canadian government) can charge a lot more for them.

Similarly if Canadian banks are paying 5% interest to savers and my country's banks are paying 2% then I will want to put my money in a Canadian bank - so I need Canadian dollars and the price of them goes up. 

Now a very strong currency might be bad for a country. If the Canadian dollar is too expensive it might be cheaper for you to buy copper from Australia - even if that copper costs more to mine - it will cost you less. The only control over this the government typically has is to change interest rates. So to reduce the costs of copper, and increase the amount of exports (and so jobs in mining) the government can lower interest rates - so all the people who had their money in Canadian banks will now sell those Canadian dollars and change them into an other country who has the new highest interest rates.

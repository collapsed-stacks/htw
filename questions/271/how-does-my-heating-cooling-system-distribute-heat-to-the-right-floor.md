My new home has a heat pump system, and has two thermostats: one upstairs and one downstairs. I'm extremely thankful for this because where I lived before only had one thermostat and it was impossible to keep both the upstairs and the downstairs at a comfortable temperature. My understanding was, to air condition multiple zones, you need multiple air conditioning units. The house I grew up in had two zones, and two AC units outside. My new home has only one unit outside, but right now, there is cool air blowing through the vents upstairs but not any of the vents downstairs. (Well except for the vent in the kitchen downstairs, which is really unusual...)

## How does my heating/cooling system distribute heat to the right floor?

My new home has a heat pump system, and has two thermostats: one upstairs and one downstairs. I'm extremely thankful for this because where I lived before only had one thermostat and it was impossible to keep both the upstairs and the downstairs at a comfortable temperature. My understanding was, to air condition multiple zones, you need multiple air conditioning units. The house I grew up in had two zones, and two AC units outside. My new home has only one unit outside, but right now, there is cool air blowing through the vents upstairs but not any of the vents downstairs. (Well except for the vent in the kitchen downstairs, which is really unusual...)

How does my heating/cooling system distribute heat to the right floor?

<p>You only need 1 airconditioner because you most likely have a 2 Volume Control Dampers(or a VCD) installed. Each of your thermostats will have the capability to turn on and off the compressor and the air handler, but they each can control the VCD for their "Zone"( Zones is the professional code word for each section). If Zone 1 needs to be cooled but zone 2 doesn't the thermostat will close the VCD to restrict the flow of air. Most of the home/small office are operated electrically, but enterprise level systems commonly use a Vacuum or compressed air to open or close the system. On incredibly large buildings these can be computer controlled for precise cooling/heating anywhere in the building. It is also <em>possible</em> that you have 2 air handlers installed, but this is highly unlikely as they would take a large amount of power to run and maintain. On building that a decent size VCDs and multiple air handlers are used but that is unlikely for your house for the reasons listed above.  About your kitchen being in the wrong zone, it's possible it was a simple mistake, or it was placed in the other zone due to duct routing and it was easier to connect to s certain VCD.</p>

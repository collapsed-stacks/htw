<p>If you have a vessel containing some liquid and you move or shake it, it would create waves on the liquid. Same happens with earthquake, when ocean floor shakes - this creates waves. However that alone does not lead to the tsunami. That creates a big wave in the ocean, but when it is in the ocean it is mostly harmless. However, when it gets to the shallow place, what happens is that the lower part of the wave hits the ground and slows down, while the top part continues moving. This "compresses" the wave and makes it higher (image from Wikipedia):</p>

<p>That's when tsunami becomes tsunami - e.g. huge wave that has very high destructive potential. </p>

When underground tectonic plates move they create an utterly massive amount of force in some direction, depending on the fault type. This force causes the earth to move suddenly. If this happens underwater, when that much earth moves with that much force at once it causes the water above the moving earth to be displaced upward. Given that the moving plates may happen hundreds of feet under the surface of the water, the volume of water displaced can be massive. This massive displacement of water is what ultimately causes a tsunami -- that displaced water moves with such a high force (about 600MPH) in open ocean, and when it reaches the shore, the wave will crest with massive destructive force.

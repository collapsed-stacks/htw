How does a bee sting work and why does it hurt? Is it related to how a wasp sting or nettle sting works?

It hurts both because of the puncture (like a small needle) and because of the sac of poison that is left in your body.  The stinger is often left in your skin as well which causes irritation.  

For most people the poison is only a mild irritant, however for others it can be deadly.

Bee stings are capable of causing type 1 anaphylaxis reactions (swelling, airway tightness, low blood pressure). Usually the first exposure is harmless, but a sensitisation process occurs:

1. Bee sting antigens are recognised by human immune system as foreign.
2. They induce mast cells in the body to produce antibodies.
3. Upon subsequent exposures to bee stings, these antibodies incite mast cells to release powerful inflammatory chemicals.
4. One such chemical is histamine, which is chiefly responsible for causing shortness of breath, swelling, rashes and low blood pressure. Can be fatal.

If you put a piece of aluminum foil into a microwave oven and turn it on, you can observe a strange blue-ish sparkling. What's the physical/chemical explanation for this effect?

Disclaimer: I heard that having aluminum foil in the microwave can harm or even destroy the device. Whether that's actually true or not I don't know, but I won't be or feel responsible if you can't resist the urge.

Corona discharges are caused by large gradients in electromagnetic fields: conductors with high curvature (sharp edges or points) in air will cause large gradients.

This is why lightning rods work: they initiate ionization of air around the sharp tip of a piece of metal; the ionization decreases the electrical gradient locally which increases it elsewhere until the ionization spreads and you get a lightning strike.

If you have aluminum foil (or other metals) that has a large radius (low curvature), so that there are no sharp edges, it will be much less prone to cause ionization, and it could actually be used as a shield during cooking (although I wouldn't try it!)

The bluish sparking is from the buildup of electric charge on the metal, and isn't unique to aluminum in a microwave. It's the same effect that you see around a lightening strike. The effect is called a corona (not to be confused with the term for the sun's atmosphere - also the corona). I don't actually know why it's blue, but it has to do with what electronic transition it's exciting in the surrounding air.

Here's a good Wikipedia article that talked about the effect, and the resulting discharge that occurs after additional buildup:

If you put a piece of aluminum foil into a microwave oven and turn it on, you can observe a strange blue-ish sparkling. What's the physical/chemical explanation for this effect?

Disclaimer: I heard that having aluminum foil in the microwave can harm or even destroy the device. Whether that's actually true or not I don't know, but I won't be or feel responsible if you can't resist the urge.

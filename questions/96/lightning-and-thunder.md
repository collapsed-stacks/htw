Simple, while both occur at the same time, Light travels at about 299,792,458 m/s where sound is about speed of sound at sea level = 340.29 m/s. This diference in speed is the cause of time difference.

The visible part of lightning travels at the speed of light, while the sound generated by the lightning (called thunder) travels at the speed of sound. This delay is approximately 1 second per mile away from the lightning bolt.

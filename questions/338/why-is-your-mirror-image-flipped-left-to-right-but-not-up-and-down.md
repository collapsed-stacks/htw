When you look in a flat (non-curved) mirror, you see a reflection of yourself that is flipped left to right, but not also flipped upside down.  Why is this, and how does the mirror "know" which way to flip the image?

<p>I'm not sure if your question is geometry or physics. I think it's geometry, so I'll take a shot at it:</p>

<p>Thinking about a mirror image as flipped left-to-right but not up-and-down is misleading. What a mirror really does is flip the image <em>front-to-back</em> and leave its left-to-right-ness or up-and-down-ness alone. Here's an easy way to think about it:</p>

<p>The next time you look in the mirror, consider the position of your left hand, your right hand, and your head. Each of these objects is directly across from its mirror-image counterpart. </p>

<p>Let's say you're standing right-side-up, with arms outstretched, in front of a mirror, and you're facing north. Then your image is facing south. </p>

<p>But both your head and your image's head are at the top of your body, and your feet and your image's feet are at the bottom of your body, and your left hand and the corresponding hand of your image are both pointing west, while your right hand and the corresponding hand of your image are both pointing east.</p>

<p>The only "flip" is front-to-back.</p>

<p>With respect to the physics aspect of this, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28physics%29" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> or other physics textbooks; mirrors have a smooth flat metal conductive coating. In an electrical conductor, the electromagnetic field within the metal is nulled out, and this causes electromagnetic waves to reflect off the surface of the metal much like a billiard ball bounces off the edge of a pool table. </p>

It's because of how your brain interprets your "left and right" sides. If you turn your head sideways, suddenly the mirror is flipping the image top-down, and the left and right mirror images are unchanged. It's all in your brain.

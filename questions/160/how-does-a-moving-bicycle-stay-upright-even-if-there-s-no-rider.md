How does a cyclist stay upright on a moving bike - given the relatively high centre of gravity, is it still just gyroscopic force or are there other factors involved? And how does a bike remain upright even if there's no rider?

Funny you ask that! Just a couple of days ago I read that the mechanism that makes bikes stay upright was not fully understood until not so long ago. Before, most explanations where based on gyroscopic forces and the location of the steer axis, but a team of engineers has now built a bicycle that eliminates both of these features, but still manages to stay upright.

More information here:

As an explanation, it seems the best they could come up with is that the stability is related to the ability of the bike to steer into a fall if it starts to lean, and that there are multiple ways of constructing a bike that does this.

Bikes stay upright because of a phenomenon called countersteering, and because of the trail in the bicycle fork.

Countersteering:

Countersteering is how bicycles and motorcycles actually turn. When you want to turn left, you first turn the handlebars right. When you turn the handlebars to the right, traction with the ground causes the wheels to be pulled to the right. Now, your center of gravity is not above the wheels, you start to tip toward the left, and begin to turn to the left to keep yourself upright. Conversely, when you stop turning, you turn a little bit harder, which brings your center of gravity back over the wheels.

On bicycles, this mechanism can be very slight so you might not realize it unless you are trying to turn very fast at very high speeds. On motorcycles it is more apparent.

As for trail:

Imagine a straight line right through the steerer tubes axis to the ground. That won't hit the ground right where the wheel contacts the ground, it will be in front of it. The distance from that imaginary point to the wheel contact is the trail. 

Because the contact area is behind the axis of turning, it will tend to pull the front wheel to steer straight ahead. More trail makes a bike more stable, but harder to turn.

Those two phenomenons working together keep the bike upright. The geometry of the bike frame causes the bike to always 'fall' into a straight line, because of the countersteering, and the trail of the steering fork keeps it stable.

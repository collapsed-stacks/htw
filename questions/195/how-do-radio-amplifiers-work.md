Let us have some kind of transceiver. It gets some signal, converts it to radio one and sends it into the space. But if signal is weak, no receiver near sender would receive it. So the signal should be amplified before sending to the space. How it's made?

in most cases the signal is first encoded into something transmittable, then amplified and connected to an antenna. 

the amplification part can be done by discrete component or with operational amplifiers. operational amplifiers can now amplify signals well into the hundred-MHz range without big problems.

Essentially every radio transmitter is an amplifier - although amplifier is more generally used on the receiver side.

The power of a transmitter is just how much current it can deliver into the antennae - perhaps somebody with more experience of broadcast equipment could expand on this?

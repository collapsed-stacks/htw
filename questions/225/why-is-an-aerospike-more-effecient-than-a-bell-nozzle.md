The standard existing rocket nozzle is a bell nozzle. This is basically a hollow bell shape attached to a tight restriction on the motor. An aerospike is a more recent design that is basically an inverted bell nozzle: it has a solid central shape that tapers off with a restriction around the edge of the top of the nozzle.

In the debate of which is a better design, the efficiency of the nozzle is often evoked. A bell nozzle is designed to direct the expansion of the rocket gasses until they reach the atmospheric pressure of a single altitude. I would imagine an aerospike does the same, so why is it more efficient?

For reference on the two kinds of nozzles, see below:

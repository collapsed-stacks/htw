The standard existing rocket nozzle is a bell nozzle. This is basically a hollow bell shape attached to a tight restriction on the motor. An aerospike is a more recent design that is basically an inverted bell nozzle: it has a solid central shape that tapers off with a restriction around the edge of the top of the nozzle.

In the debate of which is a better design, the efficiency of the nozzle is often evoked. A bell nozzle is designed to direct the expansion of the rocket gasses until they reach the atmospheric pressure of a single altitude. I would imagine an aerospike does the same, so why is it more efficient?

For reference on the two kinds of nozzles, see below:

<p>The difference here is how they react at different atmospheric pressures.</p>

<p>A bell nozzle, is indeed designed to expand the rocket exhaust gases out to atmospheric pressure, but while the pressure at the start of the nozzle (straight after the combustion chamber), remains roughly constant throughout the rockets climb, the ambient pressure falls fairly at you get above more and more of the atmosphere. The means that at different altitudes, a different shape of bell is optimal. At sea level, ambient air pressure is at its highest, and so the bell can be very short and have a very wide angle, whereas in orbit, ambient pressure is almost nothing and so the optimum nozzle would be very long and have a very small flare angle. (look how long the nozzles on <a href="http://www.hightechscience.org/Buran_Space_Shuttle_Comparsion_1.gif" rel="nofollow">shuttle and its booster rockets</a>, the shuttle nozzles are much longer because they are designed for higher altitudes)</p>

<p>An aerospike however is what is called an <em>altitude compensating nozzle</em>. How it works is that that the air pressure around the jet influences how much it can expand and therefore effectively changes the size of the nozzle as the rocket gains height. Through recirculation below the wedge of the spike, the two jets heat the air, increasing the pressure in a place that would other have an vacuum (by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle" rel="nofollow">Bernoulli's law</a>), the net effect of which is an area of roughly atmospheric pressure, which balances the normal air pressure on top of the rocket, meaning there is no <em>disadvantage</em> to having the spike at sea level. At high altitude this higher pressure actually increases the thrust to the rocket, and the decreased air pressure surrounding the jet, has the same effect of a larger nozzle, also contributing to the compensating effect. To cut a long story short, it has the same effect as a normal bell nozzle which changes its shape so suit the altitude (a <em>good</em> thing).</p>

<p>The debate about the efficiency rises from two things.</p>

<ol>
<li>Above the speed of sound (which rockets sometimes are), the pressure around the jet rapidly decreases due to the supersonic flow and so there is a drop in efficiency there.</li>
<li>The surface which the jet hugs (the spike), has to be cooled (to stop it melting), and the surface area is much larger than in a normal bell nozzle. So some argue that the gains from the aerospike design are wiped out straight away by the energy required to stop it melting.</li>
</ol>

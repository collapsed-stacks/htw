I know some aspects of the greenhouse effect, but if the ambient temperature is, for example, 25° C, how is it possible for the temperature in the car to be something like like 28° C? Shouldn't the heat be transferred to the surroundings?

Let's first list the main sources of heat flow operating on the car.

* Sunlight entering the car
* Infrared heat leaving the car
* Thermal conduction from the car leaving the car (Involves some convection as well, but I'll try and simplify the problem a bit)

Glass is a very interesting material. It is almost completely transparent to visible light, but almost completely opaque (opposite of transparent) to thermal infrared light. So, just like a greenhouse, there is more light entering the car than is leaving the car. That causes it to heat up.

There is a temperature gradient as a result between the car and the outside. The higher the temperature, the more heat wants to flow outside. In fact, the difference in temperature is directly proportional to the rate of flow. Eventually, the temperature gradient will reach the point where the rate of heat flow out due to convection/conduction equals difference of radiation talked about in the previous paragraph, given the steady state temperature.

Yes but the ultimate source of the heat is the surface of the sun - that's the limiting temperature! So there is no problem of heat flowing from hot to cold, it's still flowing from warm (car) to cold

Sunlight goes into the car and will begin heating it until it reaches a temperature where the rate of heat in equals the rate of heat being lost to the surroundings. Since the rate of loss to the surroundings increases as the temperature difference increases this reaches a stable state.

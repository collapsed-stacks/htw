I have heard a rumor that the "Door Close" button on elevators is actually not connected to anything at all, and it exists only to make passengers feel they have some degree of control. Is this true? How does the "Door Close" button on an elevator work?

<p>Interesting study <a href="http://architectures.danlockton.co.uk/2008/10/01/placebo-buttons-false-affordances-and-habit-forming/" rel="nofollow">Placebo buttons, false affordances and habit-forming</a></p>

<p>Can't find the link but I remember that most of the pedestrian crossing buttons in New York were disconnected (since the traffic timing and synchronization is critical) but the buttons were left in place because people feel they are waiting less if they can do something.</p>

It is a part of Fire Service Mode. In Fire Service Mode, the door cannot be closed unless you hold down the Door Close button.

[Here is a video demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGHjZHUat9s&feature=player_embedded).

This depends highly on the model and the maker of the elevator. Some are functional, some are not functional in normal use. One thing that is almost standard across most elevators is that while the operator key is in place, the elevator doesn't have a queue, but they operator must choose the next destination and press the button so the doors close.

By personal measure on a set of ten attempts on an elevator at work, the average time to close the doors was one second shorter when pressing the button, but I cannot vouch for the general case.

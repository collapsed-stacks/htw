Some pieces of clothing, such as undergarments, shirts, pants, etc. are made without any seams.  Since these pieces cannot be made from traditional flat fabrics, how are they made?

<p>The machinery is round when viewed from above. It will be able to make tubes, such as socks, torsos or sleeves, and the ends of the tubes will hemmed and attached to other pieces (if you look closer at the sleeved undershirt in your link, there are seams where the sleeves are attached to the torso). Probably the clearest image I've been able to find at this time is this antique one:<br>

You'll notice the sock/sleeve material descending downwards, not visible is a hole at the bottom for the woven item to continue to drop out the bottom - you can make the tubes any arbitrary length. The hooks at the top of the circle are for each row of yarn to be woven into the tube. Machines of this vintage cannot adjust the diameter of the tube on the fly. </p>

<p>Most commercial weaving machines will just look like big blue cubes, with the moving bits carefully covered up with safety shields so that people don't get wounded if they get too close. More modern ones will have the diameter adjustable while the garment is being woven.</p>

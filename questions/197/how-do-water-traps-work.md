Plumbing question:  How does the water in a U-joint form a seal to trap gasses?   Specifically, why don't gasses in the pipe enter the water in some way (dissolve, bubble through it, etc.)?

They do dissolve slightly in the water -  but not much.

The point of the water trap is to stop air (and smells) flowing directly from the sewer into your house. The water makes a mostly airtight seal

<p>The gasses don't have the time or pressure to displace the water in the trap. Part of the plumbing includes a vent to vent sewer gasses into the atmosphere. One simplified diagram shows the relationship. If you get bubbling and sewer gasses coming into living spaces, then either the water seal in the trap has evaporated or something is blocking the vent (dead squirrel? leaves? snow?). </p>

Used in life threatening incidents across the globe, present in every hospital/emergency unit. How does it bring the heart back to a stable state and saves many lives?

eh, finally a question that is in my profession. :)

A defibrillator in essence is an appliance that is capable of delivering electric energy across the body. There are two types of defibrillators - automatic ones (called _automatic external defibrillators_) and manual ones. 

<b>when do we use defibrillation? </b>

Two indications of defibrillation are <b>ventricular fibrillation (VF)</b> and <b>pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT)</b>. these are caused by errornous, uncoordinated (in the case of VF) or wrongly coordinated (in the case of pulseless VT) heart signal conduction. 

<b>how is the energy delivered?</b>

The defibrillator would first charge up the a capacitor inside the defibrillator, and then delivering the amount of energy inside the capacitor through the two electrodes attached to the body of the patient. in modern machines, the two poles of the electrode would be switched during the middle of the shock, resulting in what we call the 'biphasic' shock.

see: http://www.vced.org.au/pages/waveforms.htm for waveforms of biphasic and monophasic shocks.

<b> what does the energy do?</b>

normally, inside the muscle of heart there is a lot of potassium and very little sodium, where the outside of the muscle cells, there is a lot of sodium and very little potassium. when the muscle need to contract, some 'channels' would open and cause potassium to move out of the cell and sodium to move inside the cell. in this event, the normally negative voltage difference between the inside and outside of the cell would change. this is what we called 'depolarization'. after 'depolarization', the cell would need some time for it to recover, in order to contract again. this period known as 'repolarization'.

in the case of defibrillation, the energy would cause all of the heart cells to depolarize. they would then (hopefully) repolarize and start acting coordinated (back to a <b>sinus rhythm</b> which is the normal rhythm of the heart).

Your heart is electrical - it uses electrical signals from essentially a chemical battery to trigger the muscles to beat.  If the chemistry goes wrong it can end up with the wrong pattern of chemicals building up causing it to beat int he wrong sequence.

A large jolt of electricity from a defibrillator clears out the ions and essentially resets the heart to the normal state allowing it to beat normally. Modern defibrillators also contain sensor which monitor the heart rate first and decide if and when to shock it so they can be used by untrained personnel in an emergency.

Unlike their use in the movies they aren't normally any use for somebody whose heart has stopped - it's only when the heart is an incorrect rhythm.

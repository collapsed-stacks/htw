Elastic or "rubber" bands can be made out of several different materials, but they all share this property--when you stretch one out, it pulls back together.  Why?

They are all made of a group of polymers called elastomers (which includes. All polymers are made of long chain molecules, but in elastomers there is a very controlled degree of cross linking between the chains which allow them to stretch. When you pull the band, all of the chains straighten out (up to a point when they are all straight, which is why you can only stretch them so far), and when you let go they relax and recoil back to their original shape. The motion of the molecules over one another is not perfect and produces some heat, through energy dissipation, which is why elastic bands get warm when you stretch them a lot.

You can see examples of the materials here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastomer

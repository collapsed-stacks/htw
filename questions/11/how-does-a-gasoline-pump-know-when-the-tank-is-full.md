When filling up your vehicle with gasoline, the gasoline pump will cut off when the tank is full. I'm sure there's a sensor which does this... what is it and how does it work?

Near the tip of the nozzle is a small hole, and a small pipe leads back from the hole into the handle. Suction is applied to this pipe using a venturi. When the tank is full, gas starts to flow down this hole, hitting a lever in the pump, and stopping the flow.

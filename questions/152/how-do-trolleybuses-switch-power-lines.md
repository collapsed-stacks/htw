Whenever a trolleybus approaches a junction, its power poles magically select the appropriate power lines left or right. How?

An electromechanical switch is mounted into the wire, which is controlled by the current consumed by the trolleybus. This allows the driver to control the switch.

If the trolleybus presses full throttle, the current switches the junction in one of the directions. If it does not (goes on neutral) the switch remains in the default position. This allows to chose between two alternative ways.

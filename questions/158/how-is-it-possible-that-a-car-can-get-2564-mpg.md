[Wired just reported on the Shell Eco-Marathon][1], in which a car got 2564 MPG using 9mL of gasoline over a 10km race.

How is this possible? And how would they measure it accurately? I looked at the [team's website][2] and they mention batteries -- how do you account for battery use?

-----

clarification: I am less interested in the transmission/wheels/aerodynamics efficiency (all of which makes a lot of sense + seems like an optimization of fairly well-established technology) than the engine / battery part. How the heck do you make an engine that efficiently uses 9mL of gasoline? is it still an internal combustion engine?

<p>A car driving on a flat surface doesn't in theory use any energy at all!</p>

<p>All the energy the engine uses is to overcome the rolling friction in the wheels+tires and aerodynamic drag.</p>

<p>By making the wheel bearings very precise and the tires very narrow and stiff ie.high pressure - think of a road racing bicycle - you can achieve very very low rolling friction losses.</p>

<p>As in a regular car the main loss of energy is aerodynamic drag.<br>
This is proportional to the front area of the car and a factor which is based on how streamlined the shape of the vehicle is. Which is why these cars are very small and very smooth looking.</p>

<p>The drag is also proportional to the speed squared, to go twice as fast you need 4x as much power. Which is why these cars only move at jogging speed.</p>

<p>The battery powered cars are a separate catagory - don't know what the rules are for those</p>

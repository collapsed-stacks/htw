<p>There is a patch of tissue on the upper surface of the nasal cavity (the inside of the nose) called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_epithelium" rel="nofollow">olfactory epithelium</a>. This tissue is composed of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoreception" rel="nofollow">special cells</a> which react to airborne chemicals and send nerve signals to the brain. There are many different types of sensory cells in the olfactory epithelium. Each type reacts to a different chemical, and there are millions of cells of each type.</p>

<p>The nerve signals from the olfactory cells are connected to a portion of the brain called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_bulb" rel="nofollow">olfactory bulb</a>. The olfactory bulb differentiates between different smells and triggers appropriate signals in other areas of the brain. When you smell fresh cinnamon buns, for example, the olfactory bulb identifies that particular combination of chemicals, while other areas of the brain translate that signal into emotions like hunger, anticipation and happiness.</p>

I know that the mode of storage of CD/DVD is optical. My question is, how can an apparently flat object like my CD-RW change the optical property of another flat object (the disk itself) just by spinning them?

In the CD there are several layers of material. one of them is the reflective layer (aluminium, or gold depending on manufacturer / cost) and another of them is the dye layer. the dye can be changed in its property by means of heating, resulting in different amount of refraction in those area 'etched' (no actual groove is actually written - it is just a change in optical property).

laser is shined onto the place; dye absorbs the energy and heat up causing decomposition +/- bubble formation. polycarbonate substrate is heated up causing substrate expansion and fills into the "groove" (where dye originally lives). thus bubbles, bleached dye (due to decomposition), expanded substrate, etc. forms the "groove" necessary for readout

See wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-R) for more details

It doesn't just spin it, a laser in the drive etches grooves into the disk, it cuts very small holes through the laser melting the plastic slightly in the area(This is also why you **Never** want to look into a CD reader/burner), which form the binary 1s and 0s. From those grooves, a disk reader( another laser) can detect these grooves converting them back to 1s and 0s and you have data that the computer can use again.

In writeable disc for consumers there are no real 'grooves'. Its more like a crystalline surface where the burner changes the structure of certain crystals. The reading-laser get reflected or not depending on this structure.

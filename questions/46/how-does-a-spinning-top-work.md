How does a spinning top work? Why does the spinning motion keep the top from falling over?

<p>The short answer is "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum#Conservation_of_angular_momentum" rel="nofollow">conservation of angular momentum</a>". A spinning top (or any spinning mass, for that matter) tends to keep spinning unless some other force acts on it. When the top starts to tip in one direction (due to slight weight imbalance or an uneven surface, for example), this applies a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque" rel="nofollow">torque</a> (a sideways force) to the top. For a stationary top, this force would contine to act until the top falls over. The "magic" of a spinning top is that the small sideways torque is converted into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precess" rel="nofollow">precession</a> (a wobble around the spinning axis). As long as the top is spinning fast enough, the wobble remains small and the top will not fall over. Eventually, when the spinning slows down enough (due to fricton), the wobble becomes too great and the top will fall.</p>

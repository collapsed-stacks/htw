How does WiFi work, and why do the different versions (e.g. "b", "g" and "n") produce different speeds and distances?

Wifi stands for Wireless Fidelity. The IEEE(Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) classifies it as the 802.11x standard. It works on radio waves in the 2.4 GHZ or 5GHZ range. The different versions are revisions as technology improves. Currently N is the fastest at 450mbits, G is 54,B is 11, and A is in the 5GHZ at 11mbits. The distance is the same through all the standards ~300 feet for your normal SoHo edition under ideal conditions, but you can buy more powerful transmitters to broadcast further.

In a nutshell a WiFi network uses radio waves. Very similar to a cell phone or radio. 

The communication across a wireless network is a lot like two-way radio communication. 
Your wireless adapter translates data into a radio signal and transmits it using the antenna & the wireless router receives the signal and decodes it (visa-versa). 

Although I am not sure about the ranges (b, g, n) @Jacob has clarified this!

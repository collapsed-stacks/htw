How does a touch screen work, more precsily the touch screens on today's smartphones (Iphone, Galaxy S). The thing that amazes me is that it can detect my finger but not an eraser or some other inanimate object.

Most devices use one of the following means:

- Resistive
- Capacitive
- Surface Acoustic

###Resistive
Detects the actual pressure/ force applied to the screen from the user. Can be quite hard to use because one needs to physically depress the surface of the screen, and thus tends to be inaccurate.

###Capacitive
Our skin conducts electricity, and capacitive touch screens exploit this to detect where the user has touched the screen. Most of the popular touch screen devices (iPhones and Android devices) make use of this type of touchscreen.

###Surface Acoustic
This works by placing a microphone and a speaker along the screen of a phone, and then detecting if the sound waves emitted by the speaker have been disturbed (by touch) before reachign the microphone. This is a more simplistic technology than the previous two, however, has applications in retrofitting old phones simply by installing new software on existing, pre-touchscreen, hardware. (Mobile phones already have a speaker and a microphone)

<p>There are a couple of ways that a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen" rel="nofollow">touch screen</a> can work.</p>

<p>Resistive touch screens contain two layers that are close together. When they come into contact, a sensor is emitted, allowing the screen to know that it has been touched. This kind is typically used by a stylus, and is probably the type of touch screen you are most familiar with.</p>

<p>Most new screens are a capacitive screen. They require an object that touches the screen to be a fair conductor of electricity, but not conduct too much. The human body works perfectly. What happens is that when you touch the screen, the charge on the other side of the screen goes up. This signal gets sent to a processor, and is detected.</p>

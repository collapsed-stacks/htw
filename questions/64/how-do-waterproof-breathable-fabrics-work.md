According to the diagrams on my waterproof breathable fabrics, these materials are able to stay breathable and waterproof because they are so tightly knit that vapor can pass through but droplets of water can't.

Is a tightly knit fabric the whole idea behind these waterproof breathable materials or is there some other factor (coating) involved?

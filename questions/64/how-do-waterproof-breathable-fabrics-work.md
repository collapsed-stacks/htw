According to the diagrams on my waterproof breathable fabrics, these materials are able to stay breathable and waterproof because they are so tightly knit that vapor can pass through but droplets of water can't.

Is a tightly knit fabric the whole idea behind these waterproof breathable materials or is there some other factor (coating) involved?

Your on the right track the idea is that the material has pores on it that are significantly smaller than the size of a water dropplet, but big enough for vapor to pass through. The trick is to then densly pack these pores on the fabric creating millions of them over small areas.

<p>Some include coatings, but the major emphasis is on making the weave so small that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_tension" rel="nofollow">surface tension</a> of water droplets forms droplets too large to pass through. The coatings are intended to affect the wetting by making sure that wetting agents (such as soaps or other surfactants) cannot change the surface tension of the weave. </p>

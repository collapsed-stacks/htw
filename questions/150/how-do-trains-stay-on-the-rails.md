The question is literally this: how do trains and trams manage to stay on the rails and still move quietly and smoothly?

<p>As <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7h4OtFDnYE" rel="nofollow">the great Richard Feynman explains</a>, trains stay on tracks due to the conical shape of their wheels.  Because trains are so heavy, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_between_train_and_tram_rails#Difference_in_technique_in_curves" rel="nofollow">because of the geometry of conical wheels</a>, this naturally keeps the train centered on the track and also allows them to navigate turns despite having fixed axles without <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_%28mechanical_device%29#Purpose" rel="nofollow">differentials</a> (which are normally required because the outside wheel travels further when going around a turn than the inside wheel does).  Feynman's explanation is well worth a watch though!</p>

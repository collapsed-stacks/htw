<p>HIV "works" by attacking one of the immune system cells (called helper T lymphocytes CD4+). Its mechanism of attack places it among the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus" rel="nofollow">retroviruses</a>. It contains RNA and some molecules of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcriptase" rel="nofollow">reverse transcriptase</a>, an enzyme that transcripts the RNA to DNA. After the reverse transcription the viral DNA is integrated into the host <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte" rel="nofollow">lymphocyte</a>'s DNA and expressed along with its own genes. This causes the creation of new viruses by synthesing capside proteins, reverse transcriptase and viral RNA molecules; and then the newly assembled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virion#Structure" rel="nofollow">virions</a> leave the cell taking some of its cellular membrane with them.</p>

<p>It's hard to discover a vaccine for HIV because the virus is highly mutable and even the most important proteins of the virus are "masked".  These makes it hard to find the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen" rel="nofollow">antigen</a> that would allow an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody" rel="nofollow">antibody</a> to attack every HIV virion produced. It is also hard in general to find medicines for people already infected with viral diseases (we don't have a good medicine for flu or common cold either). There <em>are</em> some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiv#Treatment" rel="nofollow">treatments for AIDS</a> but they have side effects (because the virus is using processes that occur naturally in healthy human beings, these treatments inhibit them).</p>

<blockquote>
Viruses can be grouped into many different types. single strand vs double strand, RNA vs DNA virus, etc. A normal human cell would take material from DNA to form mRNA (messenger RNA) via a process called *transcription*, then the ribosomes would allow protein be formed from information in mRNA, via a process called *translation*. retroviruses (i.e. viruses going backwards) indicates that the virus has RNA as its genetic material and would form DNA in cells via a reverse-transcriptase (hence, backwards). </blockquote>

HIV, short for human immunodeficiency virus, is a type of retrovirus[1]. 

*the HIV replication cycle*

<blockquote>there are different types of cells in the blood, white cells, red cells. white cells can then be further divided into different types - neutrophils, lymphocytes, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, for introductory purposes.<p><p>
of particular interests are the lymphocytes there. lymphocytes (or white cells in general) are identified by presence of 'CD' (cluster of differentiation) markers. T-helper lymphocyte (a type of lymphocyte) has "CD4" on its surface.</blockquote>

- the human immunodeficiency virus attaches to the CD4 glycoprotein on a T-helper cell. 
- it then rely on its **reverse transcriptase** to make DNA from its RNA genome
- the DNA made is integrated into the genome of the infected cells
- viral proteins are made similarly to how normal cell protein are made (via transcription and translation)
- viral proteins are cleaved to correct size by **protease**
- viral proteins and genome is then reconstructed and put outside cells.

*what is made for HIV infection?*

<blockquote>the HIV infection has several are that makes target for drug action. common drugs nowadays are NRTI (nucleoside-analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTI (non-nucleoside analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors) and PI (protease inhibitors).</blockquote>

- NRTI and NNRTI targets the reverse transcriptase that the HIV uses to form DNA from its own RNA genome. 
- PI inhibits protein cleavage and thus prevents further virus replication.
- Modern HIV therapy relies on combining multiple drug in order to combat resistance towards retroviral drugs. 

nowadays there are also something called entry inhibitors. there are many types of experimental therapy for HIV infection including bone marrow transplantation (which is quite dangerous).

*why is it so difficult to get a vaccine?*

- HIV has very high variability. its mutation rate is so high that if you try to sequence the genome of HIV in a patient two blood taking apart they will be different.
- Various HIV-related proteins are by themselves not vulnerable to antibody attack (e.g. gp120) due to heavy glycosylation of the protein (attachment of sugars, one or multiple, onto a protein)
- HIV does not infect other animals in any similar way to human infection, and our ethical stadnard do not allow us to use volunteers (and who would volunteer!)

In infancy and early childhood, the thymus produces large amounts of T-cells to help fight off diseases and infections. These cells are trained [1] to fight off disease [2]. By the time a human reaches puberty, the thymus has pretty much quits working and shrivels up, however before that happens, it has produced so many colonies of T-cells that the colonies that end up in the lymph nodes end up producing enough T-cells for the rest of a normal life. 

HIV hijacks the T-cells own mechanism in order to hide and spread. This ends up destroying the colonies of T-cells in the lymph system, and since your thymus isn't producing any more, it cannot replace the now dwindling immune system. Any drug that destroys where it is hiding will destroy your immune system faster. 

Notes:  
1. There are 3 mechanisms to train these cells: vaccinations, getting sick and existing antibodies in mother's milk.   
2. One hypothesis for the rise in allergies and autoimmune diseases (like lupus and some arthritis) is that children are kept in excessively clean environments (and not allowed to stick all sorts of disgusting and dirty things in their mouths) and indoors (where they can't secretly stick disgusting and dirty things in their mouths without parents getting grossed out). The immune system, lacking any enemies to fight ends up attacking its own body.

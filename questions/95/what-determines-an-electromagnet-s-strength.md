I know that electromagnets are created by wrapping a wire (or wires) which carry electric current around a metal core.  But I'm curious, what specifically determines the maximum magnetic strength that an electromagnet puts out?

<p>What determines the strength is the number of turns that the magnet has, as well as the properties of the material around which it is wound <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_%28electromagnetism%29" rel="nofollow">(Specifically the magnetic permeability)</a>, and the amount of current which is flowing through the wire. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> has the equation, which is:</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<pre><code>  F=Force
  u= magnetic permeability of the core
  N= Number of loops around the core
  I= Current
  A= Cross area
  u0= A physical constant
  L= Flux path
</code></pre>

As an aside, please note that the *force* of a magnet (electromagnetic or permanent) on ferrous metals (iron/nickel/cobalt) has to do with the *gradient* of the magnetic field. If you have a piece of iron in a uniform magnetic field, there is no force exerted on it.

So a larger magnitude of magnetic field helps, but the strongest magnets in terms of lifting force are the ones where the geometry of the pole faces cause the field to be strong right at the edge of the magnet but decreasing rapidly with distance.

edit: as far as *why* this occurs, it has to do with stored energy as a function of the position of the ferrous metal. Stored magnetic energy is higher in air/vacuum as compared with metals with high magnetic permeability. Quantitatively, the energy density is B<sup>2</sup>/2&mu; where B is the magnetic flux density and &mu; is the permeability; B can have gradients but it is a continuous field. In the area of the magnetic field gradient, stored energy is therefore smaller when the iron is in the area of higher magnetic flux density than when the iron is in the area of lower magnetic flux density (and air is in the area of higher magnetic flux density). You have to expend energy to pull the iron out of the more intense field.

Tidal movement is quite complicated, and varies by location.

[According to the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide), the factors involved are "... the Earth's rotation, the positions of Moon and the Sun relative to Earth, the Moon's altitude (elevation) above the Earth's equator, and bathymetry." Bathymetry refers to the local sea floor shape. For example: some shapes funnel large tides in to small spaces, and some shapes allow water to move naturally in sync with tidal movement, both producing higher tides.

Prediction combines mathematical models with historical measurements. It can't take in to account storm surge and changes in sea floor shape over time, except in the very short term.

For details on prediction, [see the "Analysis" subsection of the Wikipedia article on Tides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide#Analysis)

The low and high tides are a function of where the moon is in the sky. High tide is when the moon is either the highest in the sky, or exactly opposite of that point, and low tides are when the moon is either rising or setting. 

So, the method for calculating the tides is to simply find when the moon will be in the appropriate position, which is a well known formula of astronomy. Also, one can find the previous tide of interest, and add 12 hours and 25 minutes to that time, and one has the appropriate time.

I should add that tides are actually highest/lowest slightly past the points measured above. I think it's an hour or so later than the mentioned times, but the amount is constant, meaning that the 12 hour and 25 minute trick will always work.

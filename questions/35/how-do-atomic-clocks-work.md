I know Atomic clocks are some of the most accurate clocks that exist, but how are they so accurate, and do they suffer any type of drift?

A typical mechanical clock has something that oscillates (swings from side to side in the case of a grandfather clock, or vibrates in the case of a Quartz watch which has a quartz crystal that vibrates) and basically the number of oscillation in a time period are well known, in terms of time, then you do the math to get whatever you want as the output.

If it vibrates at 20 times a second, then every 20 vibrations indicates a second has passed.

Atomic clocks uses something that oscillates much faster (some kind of atom, often some isotope of Cesium I think) and is much smaller, and basically counts the oscillations.

Affecting the oscillation rate of the arm of a grand father clock is not that hard.  (Air resistance is very minor, but real and measurable.  Mechanical resistance is small, but real).  When you look at an atom or molecule vibrate, it is not really affected by Newtonian stuff, so it more resistant to fluctuation.  Also the oscillation rate is VERY high.

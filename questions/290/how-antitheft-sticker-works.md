Most people undoubtedly are familiar with antitheft stickers that are being glued to books, disks, etc. that if taken outside of the store - without paying for the item - sound an alarm. How does this works - if you open it and look inside, it looks like nothing but a metal spiral. So how the gateway device recognizes it and does not react to any other chunks of metal? How then these things are deactivated so once you buy it no alarm is sounded anymore when you take the thing out?

The detector gates send out a constant electromagnetic field. Inside the sticker, there's a very basic coil which generates a small amount of electric current when exposed to the electromagnetic field. This current is used to activate a transmitter inside the sticker which sends out a signal which is picked up by the detector gates (which triggers the alarm)

At the counter, a small version of the electromagnetic field generator is used to change the behavior of the sticker (or even destroy the circuitry inside by exposing it to a specific magnetic field)

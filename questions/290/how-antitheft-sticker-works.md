Most people undoubtedly are familiar with antitheft stickers that are being glued to books, disks, etc. that if taken outside of the store - without paying for the item - sound an alarm. How does this works - if you open it and look inside, it looks like nothing but a metal spiral. So how the gateway device recognizes it and does not react to any other chunks of metal? How then these things are deactivated so once you buy it no alarm is sounded anymore when you take the thing out?

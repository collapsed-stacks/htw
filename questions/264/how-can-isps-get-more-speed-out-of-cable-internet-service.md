I have internet service through my cable company using a cable modem. I'm currently paying for the "turbo" service which gives me ~30Mbps download speeds. When the connection was installed, the technician said that soon they would have an even faster service, up to 60Mbps. He said they're still rolling this service out, and after a certain date if I was interested I should call and get it added to my account.

How does this work? Where does the additional bandwidth come from? What is the cable company actually doing to roll out this service? How can ISPs get more speed out of cable internet service like this?

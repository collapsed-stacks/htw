How does a Solid State Disk (SSD) in a computer store and retrieve data?  

I understand how traditional spinning disk hard drives work, but not drives without any moving parts.

A solid state disk has no moving components because the information is stored in non-volatile memory chips. In order to increase the speed of the drives, they often also have a volatile memory to especially buffer the write requests.

In a simplistic view, a SSD drive is a fancy usb stick that communicates via SATA instead of USB.

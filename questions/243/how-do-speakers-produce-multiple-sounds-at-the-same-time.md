When listening to music sometimes the parts are so complex and layered that it seem it would be impossible to combine all those sounds into one sound wave.  When listening to them live I would imagine that you are just hearing the combinations of all the different sound waves from the various instruments but in recorded media they have to be created from one source. How are they all reproduced so clearly?

The heat has to go somewhere, usually transfered to other air that goes outside.  How does it transfer the heat?

air conditioners usually* relies on a compressor to do the work. they rely on a pressure-temperature cycle of the coolant.

basically, you have a compressor that can compress the cool, gaseous phase coolant into hot, liquid phase, high pressure stuff, then they are allowed to lose heat on the outside with all those fins-laded loops, and they are then allowed to become gas again in the inside and that would result in absorbing

*there are many types of air cons without compressors e.g. evaporative water cooler, peltier (thermo-electric) cooler, etc...

<p>An air conditioner is like a refrigerator, it doesn't pump cold air in, it moves heat out of the air and moves it to somewhere else(outside.)  It uses a gas called Freon (A brand-name; there are several types of Freon, but your A/C <em>most likely</em> uses R22 AKA <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorodifluoromethane" rel="nofollow">Chlorodifluoromethane</a> {chrolo-di-florumathene) but there are literally millions of types.) It compresses that gas which heats it up, then condenses it to cool it, then warm air from your house is passed causing it to absorb the heat. This continues until the thermostat shuts the compressor down when it has reached the desired temperature. </p>

For example, when you buy a bottle of jam. You can hear that "pop" sound when you open the cover for the first time (which guarantees that your food was well conserved without air and bacteries intrusion).

How do they actually remove the air during processing?

<p>Either:</p>

<ul>
<li>with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_pump" rel="nofollow">vacuum pump</a></li>
<li>if the food is pasteurized, then the food can be canned/bottled in the presence of steam, which condenses to produce a vacuum (and any air/bacteria has been sterilized in the pasteurization process)</li>
</ul>

Most of the time they don't remove the air.

In the case of food in jars, they usually pass the contents and lid past a flame just before sealing which kills any bacteria in that small air space, and then the hot air left inside cools and contract producing a vacuum.

Most other food isn't under a vacuum at all, in fact often its under pressure. Pre packaged dinners are usually in a nitrogen atmosphere which doesn't react with the food (as so keeps it fresh), and drinks are usually in a pressurised carbon dioxide atmosphere, which keeps them fresh and also keeps them fizzy (in the case of beers, and coke). Carbon dioxide is either added in at high pressure (in the case of coke) which forces the air out, or is produced by fermentation (physically using up all the oxygen left in the bottle) in the case of beer.

Pre packaged foods in a nitrogen atmosphere are usually packaged using compressed nitrogen to push out the air. Actually removing all the air first would be very difficult and significantly increase their costs.

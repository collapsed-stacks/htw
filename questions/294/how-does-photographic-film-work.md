How does old style camera film work? How can you make colour pictures out of some plastic exposed to light?

There are certain chemicals, when exposed to the right light, change it's chemical properties. When ran through a developer, and other similar chemicals, the chemical changes will become permanent, and actually reversible, ie, you shine light through the film, the film will look like the original image.

The way that color film works is by combining 3 different types of chemicals, in such a way that one represents red, one blue, and one green.

Why do the hail stones fall down instead of liquid water?

All rain droplets start off as tiny ice crystals in the cloud, that is how it crystallises into individual droplets instead of just being a cloud. Remember its pretty cold up in a cloud so this is pretty reasonable.

For normal rain when it forms as normal rain the crystals melt as they fall (because its warmer, the closer to earth you get) and turn into droplets.

For snow the crystals never melt and they just grow into snowflakes, taking more and more water from the surrounding air.

For hail, there has to be a severe updraft into the cloud, for example in very severe thunderstorms. The updraft keeps pushing the crystals back up into the cloud, where they grow each time (which is why you can see rings in hailstones), and they only fall to earth when they are too heavy not to be blown back up, which is why hailstones in a hailstorm all tend to be around the same size, because they size they fall at depends on how strong the updraft is, which is the same for all of the stones.

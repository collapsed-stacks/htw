What are the chemical processes involved in an oil refinery? How do the parameters of these processes affect the outcome?

<p>An oil refinery has two main purposes: divide oil into components and increase as much as possible the amount of gasoline produced.</p>

<p>The first task (divide the components of crude into different fractions, normally according to their molecular weight) is performed via distillation. Preheated oil is introduced into a column with a variable number of plates, each of them punched with holes capped with a mushroom-shaped cap. Vapors from below bubble in the liquid through the mushroom caps. Each plate also has a reflux where the liquid part can flow at a lower plate.</p>

<p>The established gradient of temperatures and the balance of mass (liquids, vapor which become liquid, liquid that becomes vapor, and vapor) can be calculated and is critical for the characteristics of the separations, which reaches an equilibrium and produces light components on top column (e.g. LPG), petrol, kerosene, diesel, fuel oil, and asphalts on the bottom column. Each of these extractions are not a pure compound. They are a mixture of compounds with the same boiling point, according to a series or rules for gas/liquid separation of mixtures.</p>

<p>Once this separation is performed, the amount of petrol for cars is relatively low. Since a big part of the market for oil is in petrol, additional processes are performed to increase this yield. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_%28chemistry%29" rel="nofollow">Cracking</a> (thermal or catalytic) is used to break down the high-boiling, high-molecular weight fraction into smaller chunks, either via temperature, or with a catalizer. In some cases, hydrogen is added to regulate the final products (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocracking#Hydrocracking" rel="nofollow">hydrocracking</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalytic_reforming" rel="nofollow">Reforming</a> is instead used to improve the octane number (an important characteristic to precisely regulate ignition in the engine). Reforming is performed via a catalytic process, normally using catalizers nets of platinum or rhenium. These catalizers are highly sensitive to sulphur, so it must be removed before entering the column, or a full deactivation (poisoning) can occur.</p>

<p>The process yields a wide variety of byproducts, such as methane (which is sold as such), sulphur (used to produce SO3 and Sulphuric acid), ammonia (normally bottled or used in-situ to produce fertilizers) and many other additional compounds.</p>

<p>The main mechanism in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery" rel="nofollow">oil refinery</a> is to separate the different products via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_distillation" rel="nofollow">fractional distillation</a>. Some other important processing steps involve removing salt and sulfur. Salt needs to be removed because many oil deposits are located in salt domes, and pumping water back into oil fields is used to maintain pressure and help extract more oil from the field. Sulfur needs to be removed because it is a strong corrosive and major pollutant. </p>

<p>The difference between "light" and "sour" crude oil is the sulfur content in the crude oil with "light" crude having very little sulfur and the "sour" crude having higher amounts - usually in the form of hydrogen sulfide (the main stench associated with rotten eggs). Not many refineries in the US are capable of processing high sulfur crude oil, as more than half the refineries in the US have been shut down since 1976 due to mergers in the industry (oil companies have chosen to shut down and dismantle surplus refineries rather than allow someone to go into competition with them). </p>

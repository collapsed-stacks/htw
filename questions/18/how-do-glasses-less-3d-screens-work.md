With 3D technology becoming popular in television, movies and video games, I wonder how it is that a 3D effect can be shown without requiring glasses. How is this possible?

<p>The key idea is parallax, basically the fact that a slight variation in position can produce different visual results for the observer. </p>

<p>Your brain composes 3D information mainly from two data: parallax and focus. Parallax arises from the fact that you have two eyes, and they are separated by some space, hence each eye sees a slightly different image from the other eye. The brain uses this information to produce the sensation you know as depth perception. To simulate 3D, you have to trick your eyes in seeing two slightly different images, which the brain reconstruct as 3D. Of course, what is seen by one eye must not be seen by the other eye. One trivial way was to add filters in front of each eye, such as colored or polarized lenses. Another approach was using liquid crystal glasses whose lenses switch from black to transparent quickly and synchronized with the projector. </p>

<p>The 3D displays without glasses use different tricks to achieve the same goal, using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_barrier" rel="nofollow">parallax barriers</a> (a physical grid positioned ad-hoc) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereoscopic_display" rel="nofollow">lenticular autostereoscopy</a> (the same concept, with using lenses instead of a physical barrier).</p>

<p>One disadvantage of this technique is that it halves the horizontal resolution, and the position of the observer is absolutely critical for a good 3D effect.</p>

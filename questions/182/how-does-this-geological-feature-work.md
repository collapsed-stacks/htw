At NÃ¡mafjall, a vulcanic region in Iceland, there is a geological feature I can't explain. It is a cone made of some solid stone that sprinkles water drops up to a height of about a meter. There is some mist rising from the cone, too, but no high-pressure steam that could propel the drops that high. This is a photo I took in 1996:

How does this work, what is below the cone?

This is a feature called a "fumarole." It is generated by a high thermal gradient in the Earth's crust in the region, generally from some kind of magma intrusion near the surface, interacting with the groundwater table. In this case, superheated water has dissolved some calcite (calcium carbonate mineral) at depth, and then traveled to the surface where it precipitates the calcite. The precipitation happens around the vent hole where the water cools from interaction with the surface - both the air from the atmosphere and the water from the vent. Over time, this has built up into the feature seen here, similar to how stalagmites 'grow' on the floor of a cave.

For more information, there is a short but good wikipedia article found here:

As for why the drops are propelled so high, that's just a product of rigorous boiling below the surface of the feature. As odd as it may seem, when water is boiling very rapidly it can propel droplets to surprising heights.

The radio wave is a variable electric field in the air.     
An electric field causes a charged particle to move.     
The antennae is a conducting wire filled with charged electrons. The field causes the electrons to move backward and forward in the wire.     
Moving electrons create electricity

This very small amount of electricity is picked up and amplified by the radio.

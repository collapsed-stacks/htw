<p>Unfortunately there are many varieties of mechanical differentials, so the question is tricky to answer in the specific, but I think the premise in the wiki article is a good starting point:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_%28mechanical_device%29" rel="nofollow">almost always used in one of two ways: in one way, it receives one input and provides two outputs—this is found in most automobiles—and in the other way, it combines two inputs to create an output that is the sum, difference, or average, of the inputs</a></p>

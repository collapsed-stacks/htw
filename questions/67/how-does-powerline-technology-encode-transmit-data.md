What is the technology at play in the "Powerline" networking technology which allows an Ethernet network to be shared over standard AC wiring? How does this technology work? How far can the signal go? What actually happens to the electric current? I know ethernet uses 8 wires (4 twisted pairs) and the way the cable is set up is essential to the speed and reliability of the connection, so how can this be achieved over a standard wall socket?

What I'm wondering is, what are the actual physics at work? How is data actually transmitted? I understand that standard A/C power lines are 110 volts of alternating current (In the US anyway, 220 in Europe). What happens to the current when using powerline? How is the data actually transmitted?

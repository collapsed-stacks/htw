How does a turbofan jet produce power, and how is it able to intake water, hail, snow ECT. and still operate and produce power?

Fire is hot! A bit of water isn't enough to significantly change the burning fuel.

The big fan at the front of the engine takes in air (and rain, snow and sometimes Canada geese) it then compresses the air - squeezing it down into a small space in the middle of the engine, where another set of smaller faster blades (the compressor) compress it further.

Fuel is then injected and burns. The fuel is basically kerosene - as used in stoves - if you have every tried to light an Aga stove on a cold day you know how non-flammable kerosene is, so you need to compress it and the oxygen in the air to make it burn well.

The burning fuel/air mix then expands pushing out of the back of the engine and in the process turning more blades which are used to produce the power to turn the front sets. Thrust is also produced as the hot gases move out of the back of the engine at high speed

In modern civil airliner engines most of the thrust is actually from air that is sucked in by the huge front fan and the blown around the outside of the engine - bypassing the compressor and without being burnt. This is called bypass ratio - high bypass is more fuel efficient, cleaner and reduces the engine noise.

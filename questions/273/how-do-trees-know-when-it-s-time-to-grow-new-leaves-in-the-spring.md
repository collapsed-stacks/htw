I've moved up into the mountains recently, and where I moved from all the trees already had grown their leaves during the springtime season. Up here at these higher altitudes, many of the trees were bare and have only recently started growing leaves, weeks later than at lower elevations. What actually triggers a tree to know it's springtime and time to grow leaves? Is it temperature? How do they actually sense this? Is it a special part of their cells?

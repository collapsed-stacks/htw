## How do trees know when it's time to grow new leaves in the spring?

I've moved up into the mountains recently, and where I moved from all the trees already had grown their leaves during the springtime season. Up here at these higher altitudes, many of the trees were bare and have only recently started growing leaves, weeks later than at lower elevations. What actually triggers a tree to know it's springtime and time to grow leaves? Is it temperature? How do they actually sense this? Is it a special part of their cells?

<p>Different trees have different mechanisms. Mostly it is temperature, but light cycle variations can also make trees think that it is the wrong time of year. Some years ago, I lived in an apartment building where one side of a tree in the courtyard had a spotlight shining on part of the tree (basically, it was shining on the sign but the tree had grown to obstruct part of the light). The part of the tree within the spotlight beam had leaves attempting to grow when the rest of the tree was dormant, and for the coldest part of the year, the tree would try to put out leaves.  </p>

<p>Temperature levels change hormones in plants. It is a balancing act between the competing hormones that suppress growth and stimulate growth. The chilling will slow down the production of growth suppressing hormones until eventually the levels of growth stimulating hormones overwhelm them and buds appear. </p>

<p>Changes in the amount of light/darkness also change some hormone levels in plants. This is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoperiodism" rel="nofollow">photoperiodism</a>, and there are lots of examples of each type. In photoperiodism, certain parts of the photo receptors of the plant (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochrome" rel="nofollow">Phytochromes</a> called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromophore" rel="nofollow">Chromophores</a> are affected by light, and as the Chromophores absorb light, they cause the proteins they are part of to change. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochrome#Biochemistry" rel="nofollow">According to Wikipedia</a>, it is believed these changes trigger specific effects in the genes of the plant, causing the plant to change it's behavior:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chemically, phytochrome consists of a
  chromophore, a single bilin molecule
  consisting of an open chain of four
  pyrrole rings, bonded to the protein
  moiety. It is the chromophore that
  absorbs light, and as a result changes
  the conformation of bilin and
  subsequently that of the attached
  protein, changing it from one state or
  isoform to the other [...] The Pfr
  state passes on a signal to other
  biological systems in the cell, such
  as the mechanisms responsible for gene
  expression. Although this mechanism is
  almost certainly a biochemical
  process, it is still the subject of
  much debate <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochrome#Biochemistry" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Temperate zone fruit trees have a chilling requirement, where the tree must spend X hours below Y temperature in order to successfully produce the buds that produce fruit in the following growing season. <a href="http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/hil/hil-327.html" rel="nofollow">This link</a> has a table showing peach trees and the minimum number of hours they require below 45째F. This constrains where a tree may be grown to produce fruit. The northernmost counties of Florida are lucky to get 400 hours below 45째F each year, so most years a peach tree (a low chill variety) in Orlando would not produce flowers (and thus no peaches). Climate change will drastically change where crops can be grown because of the collision of chilling requirements with day/night time cycles (which control which latitudes plants can grow in). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Up here at these higher altitudes, many of the trees were bare and have only recently started growing leaves, weeks later than at lower elevations.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The drop in air pressure as you increase in altitude also drops air temperature. It is about 9째F per half mile of altitude gain (or if you'd prefer, <a href="http://www.ciese.org/curriculum/weatherproj2/en/lessonC3.shtml" rel="nofollow">6.2째C per km of altitude</a>). This is equivalent to being about 200 miles north per half mile of altitude. I once had a job "in the mountains" and the daily commute involved a 4000 foot elevation change (the lower elevation is the city of Denver, itself officially at 5280 feet above sea level). The daily temperature swings were pretty extreme (shorts in the city, winter coat at the office) most days, and the last snow of the year at the office was usually in May (it was a warm year if it didn't snow before Labor Day). </p>

Temperature and amount of sunlight.

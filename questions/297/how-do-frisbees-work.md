Why does a frisbee fly when you throw it, rather than just plummeting to earth?

If you inspect the shape of a Frisbee it is very similar to an aircraft wing. Like an aircraft when the Firsbee travels this will generate lift causing it to fly up gaining height if its going fast or gradually descending when the initial acceleration decreases.

Note that the spinning effect creates stability when you throw a Frisbee, the faster the spin the more stable it gets! The spinning and moving forward in tandem cause the disc to fly in a nice decent path.

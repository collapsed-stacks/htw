Mirrors and other shiny objects, reflect identical (albeit flipped) images.  How do material properties make some objects reflect light?

Does the mirror effect occur across only visible light or the entire ElectroMagnetic (EM) spectrum?

To answer this question properly one would need knowledge of basic physical chemistry.
Atoms usually have several energy levels (in fact there are infinite numbers of them but only a finite number of them occur in the visible spectrum...)

<pre>
  wavelength
  400                500                 600              700 (nm)

 |    I    I       I                             I                  |
 |    I    I       I                             I                  |

When atoms bond together, their energy level combines to form one lower and one higher energy level (to put it VERY simply)...

<pre>
                        ============
                     _,' sigma*1s    '-.
                   ,'                   `-.
                _,'                        `-.
     -----|-----                              ; -----|-----
     1s        `._                         ,-'  1s
                  `.                     ,'
                    `.                ,-'
                      `-=====||=====-'
                         sigma 1s
</pre>

and then similarly, and also dissimilarly (you will learn about the dissimilarity when you have your physical chemistry course or if you actually try to read about it in wikipedia...) the metallic bond contains *a lot of (free) electrons* and they combine together. Since there are so many electrons you can think of it as having so many levels of energy that it seems continuous (actually, it*is* continuous...) that you will see that the metal surface is able to reflect a whole *band* of wavelength.

I'll further adjust & edit the answer when I have more time... I understand that there are some inaccuracies here but I think the current form is more understandable...

A digital camera sensor is CCD or CMOS chip which records the image. This chip has millions of tiny "photosites" that do the actual recording. Typically, these are covered in a pattern of red, green, and blue filters — the "Bayer color filter array" — to sort out wavelengths of light.

But how do the individual photoreceptors work?

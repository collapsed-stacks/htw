Have you ever seen a toy (a toy car, for example) with a remote control? They do use the radio principles, but how do they work?

Typically, a remote control will have some number of servos. For instance, a basic remote control car will have 1-2, a helicopter might have some large number.

The remote control will take an analog signal, ie, how far the joystick is pushed, and translate it into a radio signal. The radio will transmit to the receiver, which will send the same signal to the appropriate device, ie, the motor or steering. Usually the signal is accomplished by sending some number of pulses per second.

There's a couple of ways these can work.

Most of these devices are active. Active means that they broadcast some kind of a signal, which they measure the return (the  amount which bounces back off objects) to determine what they want to know.

So, there are 3 common kinds of proximity sensors that I'm aware of:

1. Infrared: They broadcast a near-infrared signal (Similar to that used by a remote control, for example for a television) and they measure the returning light. If it's above a threshold, the object is declared close.
2. Sound: They broadcast a high frequency, usually inaudible, signal, and measure the return on the sound.
3. Lasers: Same principal, only they use lasers, usually invisible.

Why do most airplanes have airfoils with flaps? Are flaps required to gain additional lift to get a heavy airplane up in the air, to save kerosine, reduce the noise or allow an airplane to cruise at higher speed?

<p>Airplanes have flaps because needs conflict between cruising and at takeoff and landing.  </p>

<p>While cruising during the middle part of the flight the wing needs to allow high speed and high efficiency (which means minimal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_%28physics%29" rel="nofollow">drag</a>).  For this the wing needs to be streamlined, so the flaps are retracted and mostly flush with the rest of the wing.</p>

<p>At takeoff and landing, the aircraft will be going much slower, and the wing needs to provide much more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_%28force%29" rel="nofollow">lift</a> at the slower speed than its streamlined form can give.  So at these times the flaps are extended, effectively changing the shape of the wing to give more lift (by "cupping" the air more underneath the wing).  This has the negative effect of increasing the drag, so it takes more energy to push the airplane through the air with this less-streamlined wing form, but this lower efficiency is not as important for the short time the extra lift is needed.  (You may notice that in the very last phase of landing, the pilot increases the power to the engines, even though you are still descending; this is to counteract the increased drag from the extended flaps.)</p>

The flaps on airfoils are there to control two things: the drag on the aircraft and the lift of the airfoil. They provide an easy way to slow the aircraft, and a method of increasing the lift on the aircraft while doing so.

To see more details of how this works, I recommend the following Wikipedia article, starting with the application to airfoils:

There's a few light switches in my home where two switches control one light: If I turn one light switch on, the light will come on. If I go turn the other lightswitch "on" (putting it in the up position), the light turns off. How does this work? I remember in robotic class many many years ago we were challenged to determine how these worked, and everyone came up with circuit diagrams, all of which were wrong. I've since forgotten the answer!

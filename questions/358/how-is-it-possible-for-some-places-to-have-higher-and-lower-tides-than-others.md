Some geographical locations, like the [Bay of Fundy][1] and [Ungava Bay][2], are famous for having the highest tides in the world.  How is this possible?  Wouldn't the tides be the same everywhere along a line of latitude as the tides travel around the earth?

<p>What happens in certain areas, such as the two you mentioned, is that the shape of the bay affects how much the tide can take affect.</p>

<p>Just to show a very simple example of how this can work, if there's a lake right next to the ocean, but it never touches the ocean, then the tides won't affect it at all. The geometry of the lake was such that the tides couldn't affect it.</p>

<p>In the two locations you mentioned, the shape is basically a funnel. The amount of water over a very large area is all funneled to a relatively small bay. Thus the water must rise significantly.</p>

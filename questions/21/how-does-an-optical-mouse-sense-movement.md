I've been using mice since they had mouseballs. I know how mice with mouseballs worked -- they had small rollers for the X and Y axes and these were connected to rings with slots, which allowed light to pass onto a sensor as they turned, allowing the movement to be converted into electrical signals. But how do **optical** mice work? That is, newer mice which only use light to sense motion. What actually happens as you move an optical mouse?

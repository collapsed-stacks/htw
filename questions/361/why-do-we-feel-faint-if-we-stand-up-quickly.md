If one stands up quickly from a sitting or recumbent position, why does one feel light-headed and may even faint?

if you feel faint when you stand up quickly, you are suffering from a condition known as orthostatic hypotension. 

physiology behind orthostatic hypotension
<blockquote><i>in essence, gravity pulls. </i></blockquote>
gravity pulls blood. when you stand up, you elevate the heart, thus blood goes out from the upper part of your body to lower part of your body -- one can have a pint of blood drawn from the chest down to the lower limb the second you stand up.

the body typically mitigate this by immediate vasoconstriction (i.e. contraction of smooth muscle around vessel) to 1) return the blood to the heart from the lower limb and 2) sustain the blood pressure with less blood in effective circulation.

in many states (e.g. dehydration) the body would not be able to completely compensate for the sudden volume loss and thus orthostatic hypotension occur.

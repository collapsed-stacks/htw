Since of late there has been more awareness and push towards the use of environmental friendly products. So how does an energy saving light work? And why do some critics say to vacate the room or open a window for a few minutes when one falls to the ground and breaks?

The move toward "energy saving" (compact fluorescent of CF) bulbs was in fact started by a manufacturer of light bulbs, Osram, who had got the technology to work and wanted to boost their sales by promoting their use on the grounds of them being green. Energy saving bulbs do use less power than normal light bulbs, and are more efficient in how they do it. They are the same technology that is in the kind of strip lights you see in shops and offices. The reason some people say you should leave the room after breaking one is that many of them contain hazardous elements like mercury, which can be damaging to your health. 

The real place we will save lots of energy in lighting is when LED technology is mature. When the push to move to CF bulbs started, LED lighting was recognised as a lot more efficient again, but the technology was no where near ready. Now that LEDs are almost ready to be used in the home (they are almost cheap enough to provide the same amount of light as an old style bulb) we have the problem that many countries have already jumped on the CF bandwagon.

CF lighting works in roughly the same way as neon sign lighting, electrons are passed through a tube full of gas exciting it to release light. Old style iridescent bulbs work by passing current through a wire which glows and gives off light (and a lot of heat). LED lights work by exciting electrons directly and making them jump an energy gap to give off light.

The bottom line is that while CF lights are more efficient than normal bulbs, they also contain a lot of nasty materials and they last a bit longer but not more than around an order of magnitude. When LED bulbs become mainstream we can expect much greater energy savings and much greater bulb life.

There are several types of lights, so I am going to use Fluorescent as an example. Fluorescent lights work basically by running electrons through a substance in most cases mercury which excites it and causes it to radiate photons(light particles). Your told to open a window because mercury heavy metal which are extremely toxic(can cause  Memory loss, increased allergic reactions, high blood pressure among other things) ,so you want to open a window and let the room air out before returning to limit exposure

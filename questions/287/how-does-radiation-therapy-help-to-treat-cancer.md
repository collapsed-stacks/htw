How does Radiation Therapy help to treat cancer? Isn't Radiation dangerous? How does  Radiation Therapy treat cancer while not damaging healthy tissue?

Radiation usually kills cells by damaging their DNA, either directly by breaking it or by creating chemicals that would break it, so when cells are reproducing, the resulting cells will not be viable. When a cell divides, each new cell gets DNA built from one half of double DNA spiral, so if it is damaged, the cell has high probability of being broken and die. Since cancer cells divide more quickly, they have more probability of accumulating errors and thus die. 

Also, cancer cells usually the result of several mutations of a properly functioning cell, which frequently means that they have some DNA repair mechanisms disabled or not functioning correctly (otherwise it would repair the errors that made the cell cancerous) - which in turn means that cancerous cells frequently have less defenses against further damage that normal cells.
 
Still, such therapy is dangerous - so usually it is focused on specific areas and also uses methods like concentrating multiple beams (so that other tissues get only part of the damage while the tumor gets the whole power of all beams). But still the danger of introducing secondary cancer due to irradiating healthy cells and breaking them is there.

High power radiation can destroy cells. That's bad for the tumor and bad for 'good' cells. 

Anyway, as one can control the radiation-beam one can focus on the 'bad' (tumor) cells and try to avoid harming 'good' cells.

Radiation affects fast-growing cells more, so for the same dose of radiation the tumor is typically damaged more than the surroundings.

One also tries to focus on the tumor and spread out the radiation through the surrounding tissue, as xeroc write.

Radiotherapy.

Radiotherapy is the use of radiation to achieve control, cure or palliate conditions. radiotherapy is not limited to the treatment of malignant (cancer) disorders, but it can also be used to treat benign disorders such as keloid (google for more details: http://www.google.com/search?q=keloid+radiotherapy)

radiation causes damage to genetic materials and cause 1) failure of the cell to replicate and 2) apoptosis of the cell (programmed cell death)

Mode of delivery

Radiotherapy can be delivered as external beam, brachytherapy (in which radioactive substance is loaded into or next to the tumor in order to achieve highest radiation dose to the tumor while preserving healthy tissue) and radioisotope therapy (useful in situation such as thyroid cancer where thyroid cancer would take up the radioactive iodine and result in selective destruction of thyroid cancer cells).

External beam radiotherapy has evolved much nowadays.

in early days, the beams were set to shine through a rectangle field with shields to shape the area:

<pre>
      +------+-----------------------+---------------+
      | s    |   shielding            \   shielding  |
      | h    |                .....---:\             |
      | i    |      .....--!!"!!!!!!!!!!:.           |
      | e   ,:.--;:"!!!'''''''         `!.\          |
      | l   |  .!!'''                   `!!\         |
      | d   |,!!''                        `!\        |
      | i   |!!'      tumor area           `!\       |
      | n  ,;!'                             !!\      |
      | g  |`!.                           .,!' `.    |
      |    |`!!.                   ..,...,!!'    \ __|
      |    | `!'!!!!...........,!!!!!!___::.----'"\  |
      |    |    `''''''''___:::---''""               |
      |    '___...---''""                            |
      |-''"                        shielding         |
      |                                              |
      L______________________________________________|
                      rectangle represents beam area
</pre>

and then later, we see those automatic shielding controlled by computer:

<pre>
      |::''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''':.
      |::...........................................:'
      .:''''''':.   .......!!!!!!!!!!!!!. .:'''''''':.
      ':.......:',.!!!!'''''''         `!.::........:'
      .......  .!!'''                   `!!..:'''''':.
      ':...:',!!''                        `!::......:'
      ::''':,!!'      tumor area           `!..:'''::|
      ':...:;!'                             !!::...::|
      .:'''::!.                           .,::''''''::
      ':...:'!!.                   ..,...,!!::......:'
      .:''''::!'!!!!...........,!!!!!!''''::''''''''::
      ':....::  `'''''''''''''''''''      ':........:'
      .:'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''':.
      ':............................................:'
      .:''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''::
      ':............................................:'
                             automatic shielding bars
</pre>

and now, even using beams from different direction to minimize high radiation dose to surrounding tissues:

<pre>
                   .       !.     ,!
                  `!.      `!.    !'   radiation beams
         ..         `!.     !.   ,!'
         ``!...     .::.....:!...,:..
            '::...''''''!:'''!:';!;''':....
   ...... ..:''''`!..   ``.. `! ,!      ''':...

                           ,!'    `!.      `'
                            '      `
</pre>

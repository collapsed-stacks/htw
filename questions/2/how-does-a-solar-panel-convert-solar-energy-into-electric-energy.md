Solar panels are made up of hundreds of smaller portions called solar cells.  These cells each create some of the energy produced by the panel.

The solar cells work using the photoelectric effect, for which Albert Einstein received a Nobel prize.  In it, electrons in matter are released from the atoms upon being hit by light.  This interaction occurs because electrons travel in paths around the atom, at some energy level.  By being struck by the photons that make up light, energy is imparted to the electrons, moving it further from the nucleus.

Once enough energy is absorbed, the electron essentially escapes from the pull of the atom.  This happens all over the cell, releasing a vast number of electrons.  These electrons are then induced to move in one direction by electric fields targeted on the cell, and multiple electrons moving in one direction is a current, electrical energy.

A solar panel is comprised of many photovoltaic cells. When photons from sunlight hit these cells, semiconductive materials like silicon absorb them.  This causes negatively-charged electrons to be freed from the silicon atoms, which creates the electricity.  Usable amounts of current can be generated if you have a sufficient amount of cells.

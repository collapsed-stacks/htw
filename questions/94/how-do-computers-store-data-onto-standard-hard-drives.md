To be precise, I'm curious as to how computers physically store information onto standard hard drives (drives which use platters, not the solid state disks).  Anyone who can outline this process is invited to do so.

A hard disk is a non-volatile(loss of electricity doesn't affect it), holder for data. It features rotating platters on spindle inside a cover. Data is magnetically read from and written to the platter by read/write heads that change the magnetism to reflect a 1 or a 0. The disks are split into sectors, the more sectors the more data you can store on it. Faults in Hard disk based storage are disks are bound to fail due to moving mechanical parts, usually consumer disks are rated for about 3 years. These failures occur randomly also, some on delivery, some in a month, and some in several years.

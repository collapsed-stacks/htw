How exactly are we able to stay put on the ground and not fly away? I've done physics up to second year university but still never really understood how gravity works.

Gravity doesn't work, it is.

In Newtonian physics, it is a **law**, i.e. you admit it. There is a little philosophical problem: how does one object *knows* the distance and the mass of the other one.

This problem is solved with general relativity (with another law), none of the object *knows* the other. It just curve the spacetime and the other goes strait ahead without noticing the first one and reciprocally in another spacetime.

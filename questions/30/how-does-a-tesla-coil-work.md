At school I built Van de Graaf generators, and I understand how they generated a spark from static electricity, but the Tesla coil seems to be a totally different kettle of fish.

Can you explain how they work?

<p>A Tesla Coil works by Charging a Capacitor from a high voltage source then once the capacitor obtains a high enough voltage this allows the ' spark gap ' to fire creating a short-circuit that as a result completes the resonance circuit for the primary inductor / capacitor. The spark gap essentially discharges all of the capacitor into the inductor which stores that energy in a magnetic field, which induces voltage into the secondary coil.
One the capacitor is empty the energy reverses back charging up the capacitor some, and this process continues diminishing the power until the spark gap can no longer be maintained. This then allows the capactior to be fully recharged and the process can begin again. </p>

<p>Whats also important here is to note that the Toroid on top of the secondary coil acts like a capactior between the coil and the ground, allowing the secondary circuit to gain resonance with the primary. This then actually allows the power to increase when the primary circuits magnetic field charges transfering some more power to the secondary coil.</p>

<p>Hopefully this wall of text is helpful.</p>

<p>A quick google image search of the idea gave me this picture that shows essentially what I was refering to. 
I am linking this pic from a website named sciencebrothers.org.</p>

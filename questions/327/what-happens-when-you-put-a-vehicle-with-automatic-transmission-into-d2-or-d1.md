Most vehicles with automatic transmission have in addition to standard forward drive and revers, "low" gears normally labeled "D1", "D2", etc. Since the transmission is automatic, what actually happens in most modern vehicles when you shift from "Drive" into "D1" or "D2"? Is it a mechanical transition, or a purely electronic one?

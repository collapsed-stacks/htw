Most vehicles with automatic transmission have in addition to standard forward drive and revers, "low" gears normally labeled "D1", "D2", etc. Since the transmission is automatic, what actually happens in most modern vehicles when you shift from "Drive" into "D1" or "D2"? Is it a mechanical transition, or a purely electronic one?

The lower "gear" selections on a modern automatic transmission are usually treated as an upper limit on the gear that the vehicle control system will select. If you were to select "D" (normal driving) and then floor the accelerator pedal, the controller would select first gear, then second, third, etc. up to the maximum gear available as the vehicle speed increased. If you were to select "D2" and then floor the accelerator, the controller would select first gear, then second, but would not select any of the higher gears. Similarly, if you select "D2" while driving normally, the controller will downshift until it reaches second gear.

Modern scanners are quite inexpensive yet manage to deliver quality images at high resolutions (e.g. with each pixel covering only 1/1200th of an inch!).

A flatbed scanner clearly has an arm that slowly travels the length of the glass bed and carries a light to illuminate the photo or document.  Is there one sensor or many?  Are the sensors the same as in a digital camera? Does the sensor move or are there mirrors or lenses that focus light from the part of the document being scanned?  How do they manage to get such fine detail when there are mechanical components shuttling about?  Does the scanner partly overlap on successive scan passes and somehow match the overlapping image with the previous part in order to achieve precise registration at high resolution?

How do RFID (contactless) cards work? Where does the power come from when opening a door lock with an RFID card. I can't imagine there being a battery in the card, and there are no wires leaving the door lock for power supply. I know the system we have, you can update who's card will open which door online, but how do the door locks communicate with the central list, and work out who is allowed through the door?

It seems that stock prices are always changing in small amounts every few moments.  (Example: ABCD may be worth $17.88 one minute and $18.02 the next). How is this exact change in value determined?

What people are prepared to sell for and what people are prepared to buy for.

Generally with automated trading the changes in prices are smoothed out because the computers are able to deal in small amounts very quickly. 

So if I have a system setup to buy company X at a certain price, and buy more depending on how much cheaper it goes - then as the price the drops I buy more and more.  But the seller has a similar system which increases the price depending on how many people are buying - so as I buy more they increase the price and I buy less. 

Then somebody else, who thinks the company will do better in the future, may be prepared to buy more at the new price and the price will go up again as they buy more.

edit: This also works in reverse - if the price falls a little I might sell some. As the price falls more I sell more, and other people see a price change and sell faster.
If this isn't controlled then automated systems can drop the price of a major company to zero in seconds. This has happened a few times and most exchanges now block trades if a price's rate of change exceeds some limit.

What is of the interest to me is how exactly the reaction is transformed into energy. How is this energy considered cheap? 

Also since there's a reaction going on (an atom is being modified?) how does the reactor manage to remain stable? Doesn't the material in it just cease to exist?

After a nuclear reaction the pieces fly apart at great speed, which results in heating up the surrounding material. This heat is then converted into electricity in essentially the same way as in a coal-fueled power plant, using a steam turbine and a generator.

It is cheap, because only a small amount of material is needed to generate a lot of energy. Though in part this is a lie, because the risk of accidents and the disposal of the waste is usually ignored and left to the taxpayer.

The reaction modifies the nucleus of an atom, which is consumed in the process. So after a while (some years) the fuel rods need to be replaced with fresh ones.

The material doesn't cease to exist, rather it is transformed into a highly radioactive mixture of various elements which still generate a lot of heat, even when the main nuclear reaction is stopped.

<p>From one viewpoint, nuclear reactors are giant teapots that heat water and then use the steam to spin turbines. Generators attached to the turbines generate the electricity. Coal (and peat) fired generators use burning coal (or peat) to heat the water. </p>

<p>The fuel generates heat from the nuclear reactions involved. There are several possible mechanisms including neutron capture, alpha decay, beta decay and fission. The majority of heat (in uranium cycle reactors) comes from fission, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_product_yield" rel="nofollow">uranium atoms are changed into other atoms</a>. Some of the products change how neutrons are absorbed in the fuel rods, so those are usually called "neutron poisons." Some of the products emit neutrons at the wrong speed for fission, which spoils the balance of the chain reaction. </p>

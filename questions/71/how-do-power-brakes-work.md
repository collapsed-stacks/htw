I know that they use the vacuum created by the engine but how is that translated into better breaking force?

The power brakes apply this vacuum force when you press the pedal, so that when you do press the brake pedal to stop you don't have to push as hard as you can. The vacuum pressure assists you, multiplying the small force you applied to the pedal to a much higher level of overall force applied to the breaks themselves.

For a more detailed look at how hydraulic breaks in general stop a car, see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_brake>

For more reading on power brakes, see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_brake#Power_brakes> and <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_servo>

You are correct that a vacuum is created by the engine (or by a pump for diesel engines).  This vacuum pressure is piped to the brake booster, also known as a vacuum servo.  This is basically a big can with a spring-loaded membrane in the center dividing it in half.  The piston that connects to the master brake cylinder is connected to this membrane.

On one half of the brake booster is the stored vacuum.  On the other is a valve (normally closed) connecting to the atmosphere.  When the brake pedal is not pressed, the spring, vacuum on one side, and stored air on the other side equilibrate.  (In this equilibrium, the air side is "stretched" to a lower pressure.)  When the pedal is pressed, even a small amount, the valve is opened proportionally.  Atmospheric air rushes in and assists the foot in moving the piston forward.  When the foot is released, the spring is strong enough to return the piston and close the valve.

By doing this, the car manufacturers can make the driver feel as if the only resistance to pressing the brake pedal is the spring.  The air/vacuum combination can counteract the required force to actuate the breaks.  Try pressing the brakes with the engine off.  They still work, but you have to press harder to see the same amount of pedal movement.

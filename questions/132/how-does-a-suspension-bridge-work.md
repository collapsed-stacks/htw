Suspension bridges tend to look very similar (one or two big pillars, and a bunch of cables running between them). What is the purpose of each part, and why are so many bridges built in this manner?

<p>Well, I'll leave the very detailed explanation to wikipedia at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_bridge" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_bridge</a>, but let me try a quick summary.</p>

<ul>
<li>The one or more towers are anchored securely into the earth.  The towers must be very strong vertically, but they do not need to resist bending, as all the force applied is straight down.  As such they are often very thin when viewed from the side.</li>
<li>The large cables which connect to the top of the pillars are called suspension cables.  The cables also connect to anchoring points on land on either side of the bridge.</li>
<li>Vertical suspender cables (sometimes rods) are hung from the suspension cables down to the deck.  The deck is the flat portion containing the roadway.  The length of the suspenders is carefully chosen so that the suspension cables hang in a catenary shape; the same shape they would hang in if unloaded.</li>
</ul>

<p>These properties lead to some neat engineering tricks when designing suspension bridges:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each tower is the same.  Even in a many-tower bridge, the forces on each tower are exactly the same, as each has to support only the cables extending from each side.  These cables all have the same tension and angle at the point where they meet the tower.</li>
<li>The cables and deck can be modeled as "really heavy cables."  Because the cables still hang in the catenary shape, and the weight of the deck is distributed evenly, the force on the towers is identical to what it would be for a certain (extremely) high cable mass.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a variety of engineering advantages to suspension bridges, notably the ability to span larger distances and resist earthquakes more effectively.</p>

Electric stoves get hot enough to cook food and bake. How does the heating element of the stove get so hot that it glows red?

There are many different types of electric stoves. As Pearsonartphoto mentioned, resistive heating is one common method of generated heat from electrical energy.

There is another common form of electric stove: the induction stove.

Induction stoves are very neat. They must be used with ferromagnetic metal cookware, and they function by producing a rapidly changing magnetic field. The magnetic field induces eddy currents in the metal of the cookware, and the current in the cookware causes resistive heating of the cookware. It is very neat because it is more energy efficient than a traditional electric stove, because it directly heats the cookware, and doesn't need to heat the coils. 

Because the cooking surface doesn't get heated, you can have a sizzlingly hot saucepan, take it off the surface, and find the surface only lukewarm.

The most basic electronic device is known as a resister, which has some resistance (R). When you apply a voltage over the resister, it changes the electrical energy into another form of energy, by the following formula.

P=V^2/R

What happens is that electricity is sent through the coil, which acts as a resister, and that electrical energy is forced to change forms. Think of sliding across carpet, that your momentum is slowed down, in exchange for heat on the surfaces touching the carpet.

Heat is the most common form of waste energy, so most frequently, your energy will appear as heat. In typical electronics (Computers, phones, etc), this is usually wasted, but a stove takes advantage of this to produce something useful.

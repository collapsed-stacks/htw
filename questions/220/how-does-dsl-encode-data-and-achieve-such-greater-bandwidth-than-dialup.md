How does DSL internet service work? My understanding is that it uses a traditional phone line.. yet, provides much higher speed than dialup. Is it just a standard telephone line and, if so, how is it able to provide such greater speed?

Also, I have head that DSL speed varies based on how far you are from the source... is this true and if so, what causes it?

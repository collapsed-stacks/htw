A friend of mine has a vehicle with an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS system) installed in it. Periodically, and without any explanation, the "ABS" light on his dashboard will come on. How does this work? How does the system know it needs servicing like this? Is there a specific set of conditions which trigger this?

I got billed for brake pad wear sensors on my last service - so some cars measure it directly.

I suppose they could also calculate number of times brake applied * speed change and do an estimate of brake pad life remaining

There are a number of things that can cause this to trip. The most likely is that there's a pressure leak somewhere in the system. Other causes can include problems with the parking brake, including it being on or the sensor being tripped wrongly.

Most likely, however, there's some sensor somewhere that isn't working. Typically broken sensors will be open (Have no connections), which with the right circuitry is fairly easy to detect. Other problems could include bad circuit cards, broken wires, etc.

A friend of mine has a vehicle with an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS system) installed in it. Periodically, and without any explanation, the "ABS" light on his dashboard will come on. How does this work? How does the system know it needs servicing like this? Is there a specific set of conditions which trigger this?

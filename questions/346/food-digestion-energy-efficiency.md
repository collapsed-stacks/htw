## food digestion energy efficiency?

From an input/output standpoint, if I ingest 1000 calories, and later use the bathroom, there must be some residual energy that goes into liquid/solid waste that goes down the toilet, since bacteria can make use of it at that point (e.g. in composting toilets or whatnot).

What is this efficiency? Does it vary with different kinds of food? Are different animals more or less efficient?

(please note I am *not* asking for the *mechanical* efficiency of living things, but rather the extraction efficiency of the digestion process)

<p>The efficiency of the digestion process is not commonly asked.
A more commonly quoted statistic is the efficiency of energy conversion from respiration to external work: 20%. (This is due to energy lost during oxidative phosphorylation of food, and muscle contraction).</p>

<p>I'm estimating the energy content of human feces to be about <strong>10%</strong> that of total energy intake from food.</p>

<ol>
<li>Average mass of human feces: 123.6 +/- 40.2g (from a controlled study of 115 healthy individuals in a Texas prison). <a href="http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v57/n2s/full/1601907a.html" rel="nofollow">ECJN, 2003</a></li>
<li>Average energy content of wet human feces: 8kJ/g. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2031608" rel="nofollow">University of Southampton, 1991</a></li>
<li>Hence average energy content of wet human feces produced per day: 988.8kJ</li>
<li>Average calorie requirement of a man: 2500 kcal/day (10,460 kJ/day)</li>
</ol>

<p>Hence, about 10% of the energy is lost in feces: 988.8/10,460 x 100% = 9.45%
Note that this is often in the form of undigestible materials such as cellulose.</p>

<p>The energy extraction process is highly variable, depending on:</p>

<p>Internal factors: 1) integrity of gut (people with malabsorption syndromes eg. spruce, celiac disease will be less able to digest and absorb nutrients from food). 2) diseases (eg. people with uncontrolled diabetes can lose a significant amount of glucose in their urine)</p>

<p>External factors: 1) drugs that impair digestion/ absorption/ metabolism. 2) type of diet (a high fibre diet would result in more energy lost in the form of undigested fibre).</p>

From an input/output standpoint, if I ingest 1000 calories, and later use the bathroom, there must be some residual energy that goes into liquid/solid waste that goes down the toilet, since bacteria can make use of it at that point (e.g. in composting toilets or whatnot).

What is this efficiency? Does it vary with different kinds of food? Are different animals more or less efficient?

(please note I am *not* asking for the *mechanical* efficiency of living things, but rather the extraction efficiency of the digestion process)

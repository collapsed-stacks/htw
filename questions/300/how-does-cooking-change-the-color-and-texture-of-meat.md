during cooking, esp. in red meat, two things happen:

- the meat become more opaque
- the meat changes from bright red to pinkish to grayish

the opacity is due to simple denaturation of protein resulting in a opaque product.
the red -> pink -> gray is due to myoglobin[red] -> metmyoglobin[gray] (oxidation) and also oxidation of the iron linked to myoglobin.

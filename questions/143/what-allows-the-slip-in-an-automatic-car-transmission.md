I know that in a manual transmission car, the speedometer and the tachometer always move in lockstep (with the ratio between them based on what gear you are in).

But in my automatic, when I stomp on the gas, the tach jumps up, but the car takes a few moments to get up to speed.

How does this work?

Where a manual transmission uses a mechanical clutch, automatic transmissions typically use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_coupling">fluid coupling</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque_converter">torque converter</a>. So there is no rigid connection from the motor to the wheels, and the rpm of the motor can increase faster than the speed of the car.

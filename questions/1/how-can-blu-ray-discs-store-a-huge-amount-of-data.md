How can a Blu-ray disc can store more data than a DVD or a CD?

*(The [copyrighted image](http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/blu-ray2.htm) was removed by management, sorry).*

The basic idea that is shown here is how the fact that blue light has a shorter wavelength, allows the data to be stored and read from when placed much more densely on the disc surface, leaving more open space to be written to. Also from a manufacturing standpoint this allows one disc form the be created and written to as opposed to 2 parts with the data sandwiched between them.

CD's use a 780nm laser, which has a spot significantly larger than a DVD. DVD's use a 650 nm laser, which ends up reducing the size of the dot from a diameter of 1.6 um to one of .74 um. Blu-ray uses an even smaller laser, at 405nm, which reduces the diameter to just 0.30 um.

Keep in mind that what we really care about is the area. Thus, any reduction in diameter has a squared affect on the increase of data.

(1.6/.74)^2=4.67

A DVD would therefore contain about 4.67 times more than a CD, if the DVD contains a single layer. Assuming 700 mb CD, that comes to 3.2 GB. A typical single-layer DVD actually contains 4.7, the remainder coming from rounding errors and more efficient disc storage.

(1.6/.30)^2=28.4

Given this, one would expect a blu-ray to hold roughly 28 times more than a CD. A CD's maximum size is typically around 700 mb, giving approximately 20 GB of data storage on a blu-Ray. It turns out that an actual disc contains 25 GB, the remainder is due to more effective disc usage, and some slight rounding errors.

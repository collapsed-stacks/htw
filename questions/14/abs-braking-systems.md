Continually I see ABS as being a prized feature on Cars and Motorcyles. Why are these so special and what makes it work?

ABS helps to keep you under control when you brake hard. On a car without ABS, if you brake harder than the road can take, you skid and the wheels lock up, making it almost impossible to steer. If you have ABS the car will brake until you are about to lock the wheels and then let go for until you regain traction and then repeat. It does this so fast that it feels like the brake pedal is vibrating. Because your wheels keep turning at the same speed as the road instead of completely locking, you can still steer, allowing you to avoid whatever caused you to brake so hard in the first place.

Other answers here are correct: ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) prevents the wheels of a car from "locking up" during breaking, and helps you maintain control of your vehicle in the event you need to break quickly or on slippery surfaces. There's one thing I wanted to add which others didn't mention: the core physics at work here.

Friction is teh force between two objects as they try to move against each other, like your tires on the surface of the road. There's two kinds of friction: [Static Friction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction#Static_friction) which is between two objects that are not moving against each other, and [Kinetic Frictio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction#Kinetic_friction) which occurs when the limit of static friction has been reached, and the two objects "slip".

For an example, press your hands against each other firmly and try to slide them. Before they move the resistance you experience is static friction. Once you apply enough force, you exceed the maximum force of static friction and they slip. Now the resistance is less: this is kinetic friction.

When your tires are on the road's surface, the wheels turn at the same rate as the vehicle is moving, and the part of the tire in contact with the road is (hopefully) static. If you don't have ABS and you slam on the brakes, the force of the friction of the brakes may exceed the force of the static friction between your tires and the road -- especially on icy or wet roads. When this happens your tires will completely stop, yet your vehicle will keep going. Now, your tires only have the force of kinetic friction on the road -- they have"locked up", and you have much less control because the force exerted by steering is far less.

ABS detects the motion of the wheels relative to the motion of the vehicle, and prevents the wheels from locking up by releasing the force of the brakes when it detects lockup. This is why you feel your brake pedal push back at you when this happens. This is also why you're told to "pump" your breaks if you **do not** have ABS. It's all about keeping the much higher force of static friction.

<p>ABS is just a motor that will pump break pressure if the cars onboard computer detects a large amount of  loss of traction. ABS is a very important safety feature, as helps you to maintain traction in rough or loose road surfaces( snow, water covered). For this reason it is becoming mandated in most countries, the US requires it by 2014 I believe. Take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-lock_braking_system" rel="nofollow">this</a> is your want more info on it.</p>

The ABS system is preventing the tires from "locking up" when the break is applied. There is less friction when a tire slides over the surface than when it rolls. hence the breaking distance is reduced. Also, A rolling tire allows to maneuver (i.e avoid an obstacle) the car.

The ABS works by measuring the rotation speed of the wheel and reducing the hydraulic pressure on the break when the wheel is not rotating or rotating slower than a pre-defined speed.

There are special boats which keep important shipping routes open from ice for the normal ships to be able to pass. What makes those ice breakers able to break the ice, but prevents the normal ships to do the same?

Heavy, strong bows and an overpowered engine.

They drive the bow of the ship up onto the ice and use the weight of the ship to break it. They also often have thrusters so they can maneuverer more easily.

A regular ship could have these but the extra construction cost would be high and the shape and weight of the bow is different from that normally designed for maximum fuel economy

Pushing ice sideways is fighting against the strength of the ice, while pushing down on the ice to break it up before pushing it sideways is fighting against the weakness of the ice. Icebreaking ships tend to have tapered bows to ride up on ice packs in order to push them down and break them. Some have air jets to provide lots of bubbles underneath ice, which helps break the ice by not holding it up.

Some of the Russian icebreakers also have nuclear reactors to provide lots of engine power as well as weight to push down on ice packs. The cooling systems of the nuclear icebreakers runs through the hulls, so if the ship got totally stuck in ice, it could still melt its way free. Because of how the cooling system works, these icebreakers cannot operate in warm waters, so they are mostly stuck in the Arctic or Antarctic regions (they have to be towed through the tropical regions by tugs).

I know that clouds and fog are made up of tiny condensed water droplets.  But how come the water droplets don't simply fall down to earth the way rain drops do?  What makes them stay up in the air?

The drops are very small, so compared to their weight the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_%28physics%29">drag</a> is very big, and if they fall at all they fall very slowly. Even a slight updraft will keep them in the air.

Small things have comparatively higher drag per weight, because weight increases with the cube (the third power) of the size, while drag increases with the square.

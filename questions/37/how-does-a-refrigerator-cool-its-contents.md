The title says it all. How is the coldness being generated?

The interesting thing is that 'coolness' is not generated.  Rather heat is removed. 

Some kind of refrigerant is used, which has nice properties of carrying a fair bit of energy, (used to be CFC's, which Dupont trademarked as Freon, now other alternates are around).

The compressor is  the device that does much of the work.  After the hot gas has run through a radiator coil in the back (or bottom) with air blown over it to release as much of the heat as conduction can, it comes to the compressor which uses mechanical energy to compress the gas down to a liquid, which cools it (by dumping lots of heat via the compressor).  

Then there is a teeny device that is simply a small thin tube on one side, and a bigger tube on the other, and as the gas passes through it, it expands, and absorbs heat, as to expand the gas needs heat.  

Thus it sucks the heat out of the fridge (or the air blown over it) to get passed back to the radiator coil to dump as much heat as possible, and then the compressor to start the cycle again.

<p>Refrigeration units work by exploiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyle%27s_law" rel="nofollow">Boyle's Law</a> along with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics" rel="nofollow">2nd law of thermodynamics</a> - that heat flows from hot to cold. The cooling fluid is compressed, and this makes it hotter (Boyle's Law). Then, this heat is disapated by the coils on the back of the refrigerator (or the outside part of your air conditioner). The cooled liquid is then pumped into an expansion chamber where it expands, and via Boyle's law, it gets colder. This cooled fluid now absorbs heat from the inside of the fridge (or AC unit) by blowing what is now warmer air across the pipes the fluid runs through. Fins are usually used to increase the surface area of the piping to help heat transfer much faster, since air is not a very good conductor. </p>

I am especially interested in anti-venoms related to snake bites. Further to this, is there a possibility of creating a general-purpose anti-venom that can work for more than one type of venoms?

<p>Anti-venoms are serums containing a large number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody" rel="nofollow">antibodies</a>, which bind to and neutralise the venom molecules in a person but do not reverse any damage the venom has already caused.  This is in contrast to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine" rel="nofollow">vaccines</a> which act by causing the person themselves to produce antibodies against a given threat.  They are produced by injecting diluted venom into an animal such as a sheep, and then harvesting and purifying the antibodies the animal produces to fight the venom.  Because the serum that contains these animal antibodies is itself a foreign substance, people can sometimes have an immediate or delayed allergic reaction to the anti-venom--so anti-venoms must be used with caution.</p>

<p>As Tangurena mentions, there are too many different mechanisms in different snake venoms for a single anti-body to be capable of neutralising all of them.  If you tried to produce a "universal" antibody which neutralised <em>everything</em>, or an anti-venom which contained a large number of different types of antibodies, then the person receiving it would likely die because of the impact of the anti-venom on their own body and immune system.  However, sometimes different snake venoms are similar enough that a single anti-venom will work against all them.  Such anti-venoms are called "polyvalent".</p>

<p>There are too many different mechanisms involved in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_venom" rel="nofollow">snake venoms</a> for there to be a single anti-venom for all snakes. For example, cobra venoms contain an antagonist that stops nerve transmission by interfering with acetylcholine (the main substance that is involved in nerve-to-nerve transmissions). As another example, Habu venom includes a substance that dissolves cell walls (like meat tenderizers). What interferes with one won't interfere with another. </p>

Eh, environmental medicine- just to supplement a bit on snake toxin syndromes--

Also see @eMansipater and @Tangurena's answer.

For venomous snake bites, essentially there are 4 main syndrome of envenomation-

1. Severe local skin reaction but no coagulopathy (Cobras)
2. Severe local skin reaction with coagulopathy (Vipers)
3. Mild local skin reaction with Neurotoxic symptoms (Kraits)
4. Mild local skin reaction with coagulopathy (Rhabdophis)

In essence, the symptoms can be grouped into (1) Neurotoxicity [toxicity towards the nervous system], (2) Coagulopathy [difficulty of blood clotting] and (3) Local reaction. Quite commonly, cardiotoxicity [damage towards heart] could also happen.

With the diversity of symptoms it is imaginable that these are due to many different mechanisms and thus it is impossible to make one magic drug that targets everything...

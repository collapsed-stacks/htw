## How does a purely electrical car (like the Tesla Roadster) get away with having no transmission?

Every other gas or hybrid car has a transmission. I don't fully understand gear ratios, but it would seem to me that the engine in an electric car isn't that different from an engine in a gas car. They still have RPMs, and couldn't they use the gears to change how power is applied to the wheels?

On a petrol engine, the engine has a very small region where it can output a useful amount of torque efficiently, this is why you need to keep changing gear to keep the revs in the best range. An electric motor has a very different power to speed response which is much broader and can be adjusted electronically so get the optimum power at whatever speed you want to be at so you don't need to stay in such a small band of revs.

It does have a transmission, just not a gearbox, as the way torque works in that kind of electric motor means it will provide power from zero rpm all the way up to 14000 rpm, which is enough for 125mph.

The gears are purely to change the useful revs the engine produces (2000 - 5000 on average) to wheel speeds. Here useful revs just go up much higher, so the gears are unnecessary.

>couldn't they use the gears to change how power is applied to the wheels?

Transmissions (whether gears or belts or whatever) cost weight and efficiency. Their benefit is to allow the power source (whether engine or motor) to operate at a range of speed that is its most efficient, aka the "sweet spot".

Electric motors do have their sweet spots for efficiency, but if they're designed well, they can handle a pretty wide operating range. Efficiencies of electronically-commutated permanent magnet motors and induction motors (electric/hybrid cars typically use one of the two) would be good except near the low end of their range.

I would expect electric/hybrid cars to have poor efficiency at very low speeds (<5-10mph), but cars are rarely used at those speeds unless they're parked and turned off.

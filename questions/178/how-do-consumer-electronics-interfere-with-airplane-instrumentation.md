When flying commercial airlines, passengers are always asked to turn off all electronic devices during takeoff & landing.  How do consumer electronics interfere with sensitive aviation equipment?

Any wire will pick up radio signals to some degree. It's up to some tuning circuit to find the signal that you care about, and amplify it, while diminishing the non-desirable signals. Under normal circumstances, all signals have a similar order of magnitude, most people don't have a station right next to them, at least, not a powerful one.

What could happen in an airplane signal is that a very strong signal could be channeled into the wires. When an airplane is trying to detect a GPS, radio beacon, or other far away weak signal, then even if the signal is on a different frequency, it can be overwhelmed by a source which is very close.

All devices emit some radio signal, at least, if they have a processor that operates near radio frequency signals. In the US, the commercial radio spectrum for FM signals operates in the 100 kHz range, TV in the megahertz, and satellite and other communication in the mHz. Your electronic device is therefore, a small emitter of radio frequency, which could interfere slightly with the instrumentation.

In practice, the level of signal in modern devices is so small that it is highly unlikely to cause an issue, but it could in theory be problematic, hence the regulations.

They don't - the reason you are asked to turn off electronic equipment during take off and landing is that "in the unlikely event of ..." they don't want you to have a laptop, iPod, headphones and other junk to deal with before you can get out of your seat.
